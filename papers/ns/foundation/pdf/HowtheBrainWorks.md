# THE PHYSICAL BRAIN

## What theBrain Does

The brain is the body’s **control center**. It coordinates the basic functions required for survival, controls body movements, and processes sensory data. However, it also encodes a lifetime of memories and creates consciousness, imagination, and our sense of self.   The physical brain At the largest scale, the human brain appears as a firm, pink-gray solid. It is made mostly from fats (about 60 percent) and has a density just a little greater than that of water. However, neuroscientists, the people who study the form and function of the brain, see the organ as being constituted from more than 300 separate, although highly interconnected, regions. On a much smaller scale, the brain is made from approximately 160 billion cells, half of which are neurons, or nerve cells, and about half are glia, or support cells of one kind or another (see pp.20–21).   

DO BRAINS FEEL PAIN?

 Despite the fact that it registers pain from around the body, brain tissue has no pain receptors and cannot feel pain itself.   

Weight On average, an adult human brain weighs 2.6–3.1 lb (1.2–1.4 kg), which is approximately 2 percent of total body weight.

Water The brain is 73 percent water, while the body as a whole is closer to 60 percent. The average brain contains around 35 fl oz (1 liter) of water. Gray matter About 40 percent of the brain’s tissue is gray matter, which is tightly packed nerve-cell bodies.

Fat The brain’s dry weight is 60 percent fat. Much of this fat is present as sheaths coating the connections between neurons. 

Volume The average volume of a human brain ranges from 69 to 77 cubic in (1,130 to 1,260 cubic cm), although the volume decreases with age. 

White matter Around 60 percent of the brain’s tissue is white matter. This is made from long, wirelike extensions of nerve cells covered in sheaths of fat.
