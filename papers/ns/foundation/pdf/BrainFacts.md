### 4 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

Introduction

**N**


euroscience is rapidly advancing what we know about the brain, the nervous
system, and ourselves. It’s often difficult to keep up with every discovery. Just as
we were producing this book, The Brain Prize for 2017 was awarded to neurosci-
entists whose research explains the brain’s learning and reward system. That discovery helps
us to understand the behaviors that trigger compulsive gambling and drug and alcohol ad-
diction. Then, the 2017 Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology honored researchers who
revealed the inner workings of circadian rhythms, our body’s internal clock, and The Brain
Prize for 2018 recognized discoveries about the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenera-
tive diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.



Discovery doesn’t happen overnight, but the field has generated significant eureka
moments since our last edition. Here we can take a moment to slow down and explore the
fundamentals behind the research and discoveries that have built neuroscience. This eighth
edition of Brain Facts contains our most current understanding of what we know today
about the brain while addressing emerging topics in the field.



Underpinning every new discovery are the concepts and principles that neuroscientists
have established in more than a century of studying the brain. Members of the Society for
Neuroscience articulated those concepts more than a decade ago as Core Concepts — the
eight ideas that people need to know about their brain and nervous system. Here, Core
Concepts provide touchstones for deepening your understanding of the material presented.
For example, information about circadian rhythms fits into the context of the concept that
the brain uses specific circuits to process information. The role of the learning and reward
systems in behaviors such as compulsive gambling and addiction illustrates the concept that
the brain uses inference, emotion, memory, and imagination to make predictions.



Core Concepts icons throughout the text offer you the opportunity to place informa-
tion in the book into the wider context of neuroscience as a whole. They serve as a foun-
dation upon which you can build more detailed knowledge. If you need a reference point,
don’t forget to use the extended cover flap to remind you of the Core Concepts along the
way, or as a bookmark during your reading.

#### NEUROSCIENCE CORE CONCEPTS

A human brain contains roughly
86 billion nerve cells, or neurons. Contrary
to popular misconception, we use all of the
neurons in our brains, not just some small
fraction of them.
Each of those neurons exchanges
electrical signals with thousands of other
neurons to create the countless circuits that,
along with the nerves throughout our bod-
ies, form our nervous system. In the course
of millions of years, our nervous systems
have evolved from much simpler begin-
nings. Roundworms, fruit flies, zebrafish,
salamanders, mice, and monkeys all possess
nervous systems that share fundamental


similarities with the human nervous system.
The nervous system keeps our bodies in
sync by communicating with all other
parts of our bodies, like the cardiovascular
system, the gastrointestinal system, the
immune system, etc. With so many inter-
connected parts, however, there are endless
ways for things to go wrong. From Alzhei-
mer’s disease to depression, an estimated
one in four people worldwide will face a
neurological or psychiatric condition, caus-
ing enormous financial and social burdens.
The promise of solving these problems lies
in unraveling the mysteries of the brain
and nervous system.


Your brain can serve as your body’s
command center because neurons commu-
nicate with each other. They relay messages
throughout your body and power all of
your thoughts and actions. Neurons talk
to each other using both electrical and
chemical signals.
When you stub your toe, sensory
neurons create electrical signals, called
action potentials, which travel rapidly
down a neuron. Those electrical signals,
however, cannot cross the gap between
two neurons.
In order to communicate, the action
potential is transformed into a chemical


message, which crosses the gap, called a
synapse. The release of chemical messengers
can trigger a second action potential in the
neuron on the other side of the synapse,
conveying the message onward or, when
the action potential triggers the release of a
chemical messenger that blunts the trans-
mission of a signal, quelling the message.
This happens over and over, and with
repeated activity, the synapse grows stron-
ger, so the next message is more likely to get
through. That way, neurons learn to pass
on important messages and ignore the rest.
This is how our brains learn and adapt to an
ever-changing world.

### 6 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

introduction _continued_


Your nervous system is filled with
circuits made up of neurons that relay
messages around your brain and body.
They’re responsible for everything you
think, do, say, and feel. Sensory circuits
carry signals from sense receptors to your
brain. Motor circuits send commands to
your muscles. Simple circuits carry out
your automatic reflexes.
Higher-level activities like memory,
decision-making, and perceiving the world



around you require complex circuits.
All of these circuits arise before you’re
born, when genes direct neurons to as-
semble simple circuits in your developing
brain. As your neurons and their connec-
tions change from new experiences and
environments, those simple circuits become
much more complex. These changes hap-
pen mostly in childhood but continue over
your whole life — all a part of building a
better brain.



You’ve had most of the neurons in
your brain since birth. Most of those will
stick around for the rest of your life, yet
your brain is constantly changing — neu-
roscientists call this plasticity. Learn a new
skill or language and your brain reacts by
strengthening or weakening the connections
between neurons — even creating new ones.
Each new experience shapes your brain to
become uniquely yours.
That capacity to change is vital. A brain
damaged by injury or disease may eventually



regain lost abilities — rerouting connections
and sometimes even growing new neu-
rons, but only quite slowly if at all. At the
same time, in a healthy brain neurons die
off, too. During development, the human
brain grows an excess of neurons. Early in
life, the brain eliminates those extra cells,
keeping only those connections you need in
a process called synaptic pruning. Later on,
unused neurons can wither away. Physical
and mental exercise preserves them, keeping
your brain healthy.


**How Your Brain Processes Information**

**How Experience Shapes Your Brain**

### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 7

Your brain’s roughly 86 billion inter-
connected neurons endow it with the ability
to understand the world, plan actions, and
solve problems. Doing so requires the brain
to incorporate all available information. By
combining information from all of your
body’s senses, the brain paints a picture of
the world around you. Then, using infer-
ence and instinct, the brain makes sense of
the picture it assembles.
The brain both makes and uses emo-
tions, which are value judgments that help
the brain respond effectively to events. It


associates the pictures it assembles with
feelings to form memories. Our brains store
those memories, learn from them, and use
that knowledge in the future. By combining
all of these tools with imagination, your
brain can predict future events, calculate
your next move, and devise plans for future
opportunities. Consciousness requires that
all of these activities function normally. In
other words, your brain’s trillions of con-
nections work together to understand the
world, to think about the future, and to
create ... you.


One thing that makes humans special
is our talent for talking. Whether it’s a
professor’s technical discourse or a late night
comic’s zingy one-liner, humans communi-
cate in ways that are far more complex than
those of other animals because our brains
are amply wired for it.
Compared with other animals, the
human brain possesses an enormous cere-
bral cortex that is brimming with neural
circuits dedicated to language. Neurons in
the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes of


the cortex form circuits that interpret the
sounds and symbols of language.
We use those circuits to generate words,
turn them into sounds, and understand the
sounds we hear back. From birth, our brains
are primed to learn language. Language en-
dows us with thoughts and creativity. With
it, we can trade ideas and information, share
our observations, and let others build on
our discoveries. Over time, that has led to
human culture and all of the inventions of
modern society.

### 8 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience


Did you know that your brain runs on
only 25 watts of electricity — enough to pow-
er an LED light bulb? Or that there are nearly
10,000 different types of neurons in your
brain? The fact that we know these things —
or even care — is due to a special ability that
arises in our complex brains: curiosity.
From a very early age, curiosity drives
us to understand our world, our communi-
ties, our bodies, and even our own brains.
For the last two hundred years, the study
of neuroscience has allowed us to do just
that. We’ve learned how individual neurons
work at a molecular level, and how billions



of them work together to let you talk, learn,
and imagine. We are learning why sugar
is so hard to avoid, how exercise helps the
brain, and why the urge to scratch when
we have an itch is so irresistible.
Along the way, this exploration has led
to innumerable insights that have helped us
to solve human problems. We have treat-
ments for pain and Parkinson’s disease, and
more are on their way. Depression and
Alzheimer’s disease are divulging their
secrets. Still, much remains to be learned
about the brain, and there are many more
discoveries to be made.



The United Nations estimates that
neurological and psychiatric conditions
like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
and depression afflict one in four people
worldwide. They cause more total disabil-
ity than do heart attacks, cancers, or HIV/
AIDS each year, inflicting profound suf-
fering and robbing patients of health and
independence. In doing so, they also leach
an estimated $1.5 trillion from the U.S.
economy alone. Those numbers, and the
human stories behind them, are among the
driving forces behind neuroscience.
Neuroscientists study the biology of
nerves and the brain, in both animals and
humans, in order to understand these
destructive conditions — and ultimately
find a treatment or cure. When a promising
treatment emerges, neuroscientists work with



other medical professionals to carefully test
the remedy in animals and, eventually, in
humans. If it proves safe and effective in those
tests, the medicine is approved for patients
nationwide. Researchers have been using that
process to fight the devastation of neurologi-
cal disorders and mental illness for decades.
In the 1950s and ’60s, it led to the med-
ication L-dopa, which has helped millions of
patients to beat back symptoms of Parkin-
son’s disease. In the 1990s, it yielded a class
of drugs called Selective Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors, like Prozac, to treat depression.
Today, neuroscience research is leading to
promising advances for a host of conditions,
from Alzheimer’s disease to epilepsy to schizo-
phrenia. In a field in which every advance has
the chance to help ease suffering, research is
more than a job: It’s a human imperative.

To study the human brain, sometimes a petri dish is more useful than the real thing. This image shows a neural
rosette, a model of the developing human brain that scientists use to study how new cells are born.

In the center of the rosette are precursor cells, specialized cells that create new neurons and glia by dividing
themselves. The red ring is a visualization of the connections between these precursor cells. As they generate
new neurons and glia, the newborn cells radiate out from the center of the rosette to the outer edge of the brain
using the precursor cells as a scaffolding, marked in green. With this model, scientists can directly observe the
processes behind the developing human brain from the earliest stages.

he brain is literally the “nerve
center” of your body — it
contains billions of neurons
that transmit information from the
body and the outside world, and
then programs our responses — con-
scious and unconscious movements,
thoughts, emotions, and memories.
What’s more, your brain can do all
these things simultaneously: You can
throw a ball while talking to a friend,
plan dinner while you’re shopping, or
daydream about a balloon ride as you
drive to work. Your brain can pull off
these feats of multitasking because it
is split into many distinct regions spe-
cialized for specific tasks and abilities.



Major Brain Landmarks
The largest part of the human
brain is the cerebrum. It is
divided into two large, separate
hemispheres, one on the left side, the
other on the right. The hemispheres
are connected by bundles of nerve
fibers that carry information from one
side of your brain to the other. The
largest of these bundles forms a bridge
between the cerebral hemispheres and
is called the corpus callosum.
The surface of the cerebrum is
a deeply folded layer of nerve tissue
called the cerebral cortex. Its deep
folds increase the area of the cerebral
cortex, creating space in this surface
layer for more neurons, which increase
the brain’s processing power. Just as
explorers use landmarks like rivers
and mountain ranges to describe and
map continents, neuroscientists use
the deepest divisions of the cerebrum
to identify regions of each hemisphere
as separate lobes — distinct regions
that have characteristic functions. This
“brain map” will serve as a useful trail
guide as you explore the brain in the
chapters ahead.

**Brain Basics 1**

The frontal lobes are at the front of
the brain, immediately above the eyes.
Parts of these lobes coordinate volun-
tary movements and speech, memory
and emotion, higher cognitive skills
like planning and problem-solving, and
many aspects of personality.
The parietal lobes are located at
the top of the brain, immediately be-
hind the frontal lobes. They integrate
sensory signals from the skin, process
taste, and process some types of
visual information.
The back of the brain houses the
occipital lobes. They process visual
information and are responsible for
recognizing colors and shapes and
integrating them into complex
visual understanding.
The temporal lobes lie on the
sides of the brain, at and below the
level of the eyes. They carry out
some visual processing and interpret
auditory information. The hippo-
campus consists of curved structures
lying beneath the cerebral cortex; it
is a region of the temporal lobes that
encodes new memories. Another deep
structure within each temporal lobe,
the amygdala, integrates memory
and emotion.
The hippocampus and amygdala
are part of the limbic system, a group
of structures deep within the brain
that help regulate our emotion and
motivation. Other parts of the limbic
system include the thalamus, which
integrates sensory information and
relays it to other parts of the brain, and
the hypothalamus, which sends hor-
monal signals to the rest of the body
through the pituitary gland. These
structures, together with the cerebral
cortex, make up the forebrain.
The midbrain sits beneath the
thalamus. It includes distinct groups
of neurons that coordinate eye move-


ments like blinking and focusing, and
trigger reflexes to sounds. An example
is the startled jump when you are sur-
prised by a loud noise. Other regions
of the midbrain inhibit unwanted
body movements and help coordinate
sensory input and motor output to
manage the fine motor control that
enables you to write with a pen or play
a musical instrument.
Some of these regions — along
with parts of the forebrain — form a
collection of structures called the basal
ganglia, which helps regulate complex
body movements.
The hindbrain plays roles in glu-
cose regulation and sleep and includes
several regions that help control move-
ment. The cerebellum, tucked under-
neath the occipital lobe at the very
back of the brain, is the second-largest
part of the brain in volume, containing



over half the brain’s neurons. Like the
cerebrum, the cerebellum is deeply
folded, divided into two hemispheres,
and carries out a variety of functions.
For example, it coordinates voluntary
movements and helps the brain learn
new motor skills. It also has roles in
spatial and temporal perception. A
patient with cerebellar damage might
have a jerky, arrhythmic gait or might
be unable to accurately touch his
finger to his nose.
Below the cerebellum is the pons,
which influences breathing and pos-
ture. Another part of the hindbrain,
the medulla, carries nerve pathways
connecting the brain to the spinal cord
and contains neural networks that help
control basic functions like swallow-
ing, heart rate, and breathing. Together,
the midbrain, pons, and medulla
make up the brainstem.



Pictured are the brain’s four principal lobes. The frontal lobe, responsible for attention,
planning, and decision-making, is labeled blue. The temporal lobe, associated with language,
memory, and emotion, is labeled in green. The parietal lobe, which integrates information from
the senses, is labeled in yellow. And the occipital lobe, responsible for vision, is labeled in pink.

### 12 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**1 Brain Basics**

**Brain Evolution**
It’s hard to believe that our
complex human brain evolved
from a simple tube. The earliest
vertebrates probably had brains much
like the one in the modern lancelet
_Amphioxus_ — little more than a wide
spot in the hollow nerve cord running
down its back. But while the lancelet’s
brain looks simple, it still contains
specialized regions where neurons
process specific kinds of information,
like the presence of light or the chemi-
cals drifting through the water. In its
early development, the human brain
began as a simple tube, and even today
it is divided into the same kinds of
regions as the brains of our ancestors.
In early vertebrates, the “brain”
end of the nerve cord developed
three distinct bulges as neurons were
added, improving processing in sen-
sory and motor reflex regions. These
bulges became the forebrain, the
midbrain, and the hindbrain. In the
forebrain, the region able to detect
chemicals expanded to form the ol-
factory bulbs, and with the evolution
of image-producing eyes, light-sens-
ing regions expanded and began
processing more complex visual sig-
nals. The cerebellum appeared as the
hindbrain and expanded the regions
that control escape movements and
orient the body in space. Both these
functions are far more important to
an actively swimming fish than to a
sedentary lancelet buried in the sand.
Regions that could rapidly process
visual and auditory information and
trigger appropriate escape, feeding, or
mating behaviors also expanded in ver-
tebrates. Over time, those new types
of neurons made the forebrain balloon
out, forming the cerebral hemispheres.
In early mammals, cortical tissues in
the cerebrum and the cerebellum


expanded even further, packing new
neurons into layers and folds gen-
erating more complex tissues with
increased processing power.



NEURAL NETWORKS
Information moves from one
region of your brain to
another via chains of neurons that
can transmit signals over long dis-
tances. When the nerve fibers of
region-spanning neurons form distinct
bundles, these are called nerve tracts.
Examples of major nerve tracts include
the corpus callosum (the thick bundle
of neurons connecting your left and
right cerebral hemispheres) and the
smaller anterior commissure that
transmits signals between the left
and right temporal lobes.
A group of nerve tracts connect-
ing a series of regions in the brain is
called a neural network. Neural net-
works route signals through the brain
along a linear pathway, analyzing and
organizing different types of informa-
tion within fractions of a second.
Have you ever wondered what
happens in your brain when you watch
a movie? Your brain turns a panoply
of moving shapes into recognizable
characters and scenery. The process
begins with photoreceptors, cells in
the retina that trigger electrical signals
in response to specific wavelengths
of light. Once those signals reach the
optic nerve, they travel through the
optic tract to the thalamus, where
neurons respond to the shape, color, or
movement of objects on the screen and
pass their signals to the primary visual
cortex in the occipital lobe, at the back
of the brain. Neurons in the primary
visual cortex, in turn, detect the edges
of objects within the field of vision
and integrate the signals from each
eye, creating a three-dimensional



representation of the outside world.
The image is even further refined as
signals are sent down two parallel
processing streams. In one stream,
neurons in the temporal lobe recognize
and identify objects; in the other,neu-
rons in the parietal lobe detect the
spatial location of those objects. And
that’s only the visual input from the
film! New technologies that allow us to
look with increasing detail at the brain
regions being activated as we perform
different functions are giving us in-
creasing insight into the fine regions of
the brain used for specific tasks.



Network Activity
Creates Brain Waves
The visual cortex also sends sig-
nals back to the thalamus to become
integrated with other sensory infor-
mation; this is an example of a “thal-
amocortical loop,” a two-way circuit
that connects the thalamus with parts
of the cortex and back. As neuronal
signals loop through the thalamus
and cortex, they produce rhythmic,
oscillating, electrical patterns that can
be detected with an electroencephalo-
graph (EEG). These signals are com-
monly called brain waves. There are
four distinct types, each recognized
by its characteristic shape on an EEG
display or printout.
Your awake brain typically produc-
es alpha waves and beta waves. Alpha
waves originate mainly in the parietal
and occipital lobes when your brain
is relaxed and eyes are closed, and are
characterized by frequencies between
8 and 13 Hz. (The Hertz is a mea-
sure of frequency; 1 Hz = 1 cycle per
second.) Beta waves are somewhat
faster, with frequencies ranging from
14 to 30 Hz. Beta waves are typically
produced by the frontal and parietal
regions of your brain when it processes


### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 13

**Brain Basics 1**

sensory input or concentrates on a
task. Theta waves and delta waves are
typical of sleep. Theta waves are slower
than alpha waves, ranging from 4 to
7 Hz, while delta waves, which occur
during deep sleep, are very slow, with
frequencies less than 3.5 Hz. Alpha
and delta waves are typically of higher
amplitude (stronger) than beta or theta
waves but, when measured with elec-

trodes on your scalp, all these signals
are in the microvolt range: 20–200 μV
for alpha and delta waves, and 5-
μV for beta and theta waves.

**Neural Networks Organize
and Integrate Information**
Your brain and spinal cord con-
tain many distinct neural networks.
These include spinal tracts — chains
of neurons that pass signals through
the brainstem and the spinal cord.
Signals either travel upward from
sensory receptors in skin and mus-
cles to the thalamus and parts of the
cortex that interpret touch and pres-
sure; or they travel downward from
brain regions that induce movement,
passing through the medulla and
spinal cord before projecting to the
body’s muscles. Other neural net-


works provide feedback that helps
integrate sensory and motor signals.
For example, the brain’s basal ganglia
are part of a feedback loop that takes
information from cortical areas that
elicit movement and produces signals
that feed back to the cortex to excite
or inhibit specific movements. Loops
that connect the brainstem and the
cerebellum also influence the timing



and strength of motor signals; some
of these loops incorporate tracts
from the cerebral cortex that en-
able environmental and emotional
context to influence your body’s
movements. Networks that loop the
hippocampus into sensory cortex
pathways help your brain analyze
whether environmental signals are
familiar or are part of a new situa-
tion. Related networks linking the
hippocampus to the thalamus and
hypothalamus allow your memory
to influence conscious behavior as
well as unconscious physiological
responses. Reflex loops are circuits
eliciting action well before thoughts;
these actions are controlled locally by
information going in and out of the
spinal cord or subcortical regions of
the brain, and never reach the cortex.


#### NEURAL CIRCUITS


Each region of your brain
analyzes only a specialized
subset of all the information that is
received, but all regions use the same
basic mechanism to process informa-
tion. When signals arrive at a brain
region, they engage local neural
circuits — interconnected neurons
that turn entering signals into output
patterns that can be sent to other
parts of the brain.
The cerebral cortex is packed
with neural circuits. Neurons are
organized into a stack of distinct
layers that span the thickness of the
cortex like shelves in a bookcase.
Circuits are arranged in columns, as
each neuron forms connections with
cells in the layers above and below.
The neurons in a column form a
single chain, and signals that enter
the circuit travel down that chain
from one neuron to the next. Each
time the signal is fed forward, it is
transformed in some way, building
outputs that encode complex infor-
mation — so you can recognize
your grandmother’s face in a crowd
or plan where to run to catch a
thrown ball.
Neuroscientists think each
column in the cortex is dedicated
to one very specific processing task.
But a column’s final output can be
influenced by the activity of nearby
circuits. Every neuron in a circuit
has other connections to neurons in
neighboring columns. Since every
neuron behaves like a microprocessor,
summing all the signals it receives
before sending one of its own, the
strength of signals from neighbor-
ing circuits can dynamically shift
a neuron’s response. This dynamic
organization may help the brain react
flexibly to different situations.


Neurons are organized into a

stack of distinct layers that span

the thickness of the cortex like

shelves in a bookcase.

**Excitatory and
Inhibitory Neurons**
Individual neurons are either
excitatory or inhibitory. The majority
of neurons in your brain — about
80 percent of them — are excitatory,
sending signals that push their neigh-
bors toward firing. In many parts of
the cerebral cortex, the most common
type of excitatory neuron is the pyra-
midal cell, named for its cone-shaped
cell body. Each pyramidal cell has two
sets of branched dendrites — one set
at the apex and another set of shorter
dendrites at the base — that collect
signals from neurons in every layer
of the cortex. A multi-branched axon
sends a single electrical signal to mul-
tiple destinations. The 20 percent of
your brain’s neurons that are inhibitory
send signals that suppress the activity
of neighboring neurons and regulate
the activity of a circuit.
Every neural circuit contains both
excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
Neurons that pass signals forward
through a circuit and eventually send
outputs to other parts of the brain
tend to be excitatory, while inhibitory
neurons are typically local and often
loop their responses back to earlier
segments of a circuit. The interplay
between these signals in a circuit seems
to be important in learning, tuning
and smoothing the signals sent to the
body and other parts of the brain.
Seizure disorders like epilepsy could be
caused by imbalances in the activity of
excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
Within circuits, neurons can be
organized in a number of different
input architectures, each affecting how
a circuit manages information. In a
feed-forward inhibitory circuit, inhib-
itory interneurons connect neighbor-
ing neural circuits in such a way that
excitatory signals in one column


simultaneously send inhibitory signals
to adjacent columns, reducing their
activity. In feedback inhibition,
however, neurons send signals to their
downstream excitatory neighbors and
to interneurons that reach back and
inhibit preceding layers of the same
circuit. Both are examples of recurrent
neural networks, in which neurons
inside interconnected circuits send
feedback signals to one another.



NEURONS AND GLIA
The functional unit of neural
circuits and networks is the
neuron, a specialized cell that can
transmit electrical signals to other
nerve cells, muscles, or glands. Neu-
rons come in a broad range of shapes
and sizes, but all of them have a cell
body, dendrites, and an axon. The cell
body, also called the soma, contains



the neuron’s nucleus and most of its
cytoplasm, along with molecular
machinery for building and transport-
ing proteins critical to the cell’s
function. Dendrites are branched
projections that extend from the cell
body and collect incoming signals
from other neurons. The neuron’s
electrical signals travel down its axon
— another extension from the cell
body that may branch before ending in
axon terminals, where the signal is
passed across a synapse to other cells.
In some neurons, axons are only a
fraction of a centimeter long; in others,
they may extend more than a meter.
Neurons are associated with sup-
port cells called glia. Neuroscientists
have long believed that glia outnumber
neurons by 10:1 (or more). However,
recent investigations suggest that in
some regions of the brains of humans



This is the neuron, the building block of the nervous system. Neurons come in many shapes
and sizes, but most have some basic features. The cell body contains structures such as the
nucleus. Dendrites, the arms extending from the cell body, receive signals from other neurons at
junctions called synapses. The neuron sends signals via the axon, a long cable that ends with
the axon terminals. The axon terminals release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.

and other primates, that ratio is closer
to 1:1. However, the ratio of glia to
neuron from region to region varies
considerably. The central nervous sys-
tem contains four main types of glial
cells: astrocytes, microglia, ependymal
cells, and oligodendrocytes. Astrocytes
form a network inside the brain that
regulates ion concentrations around
neurons, provides them with nutrients,
and helps regulate the formation of
new connections between neurons.
Microglia are the main “immune cells”
of the brain. They function mainly
as phagocytes — helping protect the
brain from infections and cellular
damage — but can also regulate the
formation of new neuronal connec-
tions. Ependymal cells make the cere-
brospinal fluid that cushions the brain
inside the skull, and oligodendrocytes
improve neuron function by wrapping
axons in a fatty sheath called myelin.

**Ion Channels and
Action Potentials**
Ions are electrically charged atoms
that can only cross a neuron’s cell
membrane through tunnel-like pro-
teins called ion channels. These
tunnel-like proteins act like gates, al-
lowing some ions to enter or leave the
cell, but keeping others out. Ions that
enter or leave the cell change the volt-
age difference across the membrane.
This change in voltage influences the
neuron’s likelihood of generating an
electrical signal.
In mammals, the voltage difference
across the membrane of a resting neu-
ron is around -70 millivolts (mV), more
negative inside the cell than on its outer
surface. That membrane potential is
affected by signals arriving from other
neurons in its circuit, which can make
the membrane potential less negative
(depolarized) or more negative


(hyperpolarized) by opening ion
channels in the dendrites. If the sum
of all the signals at the dendrites rises
to match the membrane’s threshold
voltage, a series of voltage-sensitive ion
channels opens automatically, triggering
an electrical impulse called an action
potential, which moves down the axon
towards the next neuron in the circuit.



SYNAPSES AND
NEUROTRANSMISSION
Signals are passed from one
neuron to the next at junctions
called synapses. In most circuits, a
synapse includes the end of an axon, the
dendrite of an adjacent neuron, and a
space between the two called the
synaptic cleft. Amazingly, this separa-
tion between neurons was only verified
(by electron microscopy) in the 1950s.
The cleft is wide enough that electrical



signals can’t directly impact the next
neuron; rather, chemical signals called
neurotransmitters cross the synapse. This
process is called neurotransmission.
When an action potential arrives
at the axon terminal, the voltage
change triggers ion channels in the
membrane to open, which lets calci-
um ions flow into the cell. When the
calcium ions bind to packages of neu-
rotransmitter molecules called synaptic
vesicles, the vesicles fuse with the cell
membrane at the axon terminal and
empty their contents into the synap-
tic cleft. Afterwards, pieces of axon
terminal membrane cycle back into the
soma as new vesicles, which are refilled
with neurotransmitter molecules.
Many substances act as nero-
transmitters, including amino acids,
gases, small organic chemicals, and
short peptides. Neurons can synthesize



Dendrites — the arms extending from a neuron’s cell body — receive information from other
neurons at sites called synapses. Each dendrite can have thousands of synapses, which
together form complex circuits that govern brain function. The synapses on this mouse
neuron are labeled in yellow and red.

small _non_ -peptides like dopamine or
acetylcholine inside the axon termi-
nal. But an axon terminal doesn’t
contain the molecular machinery for
building proteins, so peptide-based
neurotransmitters are built in the
ribosome-rich space of the cell body.
Vesicles containing neurotransmit-
ter “cargos” bud off from the wall

of the Golgi apparatus — the cell’s
protein-packaging organelle — then
bind to proteins called kinesins that
work their way down the axon along
microtubules, filamentous parts of the
cellular skeleton.
After neurotransmitters are
released from an axon terminal,
they drift across the synaptic cleft
until they reach the outer surface
of the dendrite, a region that looks
thick or dense in highly magnified
images. This region, the postsyn-
aptic density, has a high concentra-
tion of neurotransmitter receptors.
Many different molecules act as
neurotransmitters, and each one fits
into specific receptors like a key fits
a lock. Receptors are linked to ion
channels in such a way that, when
neurotransmitter molecules dock on
their receptors, they open those


channels, altering the voltage across
the postsynaptic membrane. Local
glial cells (astrocytes) mop up any ex-
cess neurotransmitters at the synapse.
This process prevents them from
continuously activating receptors.
There are two broad types of
receptors on the postsynaptic mem-
brane. In an ionotropic receptor, a



neurotransmitter binds directly to
part of an ion channel. The chan-
nel is normally closed; the receptor
protein changes its shape when the
neurotransmitter attaches, widen-
ing the tunnel in the center of the
ion channel so that ions can move
through. Metabotropic receptors are
more complex. The receptor and the
ion channel are different proteins lo-
cated at a distance from one another,
but they are linked by a cascade of
biochemical steps that are triggered
when a neurotransmitter binds to the
receptor. This response is less rapid
and activates a series of events inside
the postsynaptic cell. The result may
be opening an ion channel some dis-
tance away or activating other intra-
cellular molecules.
Neurotransmitter molecules only
bind to their receptors for a short



time. Once they detach, the ion
channels return to their resting state
and stop altering the charge across
their membrane. The neurotrans-
mitters are either broken down or
reabsorbed by the axon terminal in a
process called reuptake.
The excitatory and inhibitory
neurons described above can be
identified by the specific neurotrans-
mitters that they make. Excitatory
neurons make neurotransmitters that
open ion channels that depolarize
the dendrite’s membrane; inhibitory
neurons make neurotransmitters that
hyperpolarize it. The brain’s most
common excitatory neurotransmitter
is glutamate; the brain’s most com-
mon inhibitory neurotransmitter is
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
Glutamate is an amino acid used
as a neurotransmitter by approximate-
ly half the excitatory synapses in the
brain. It can bind to several types of
ionotropic receptors; the most im-
portant of these are AMPA receptors
and NMDA receptors. When acti-
vated, the action of AMPA receptors
is fast and brief; NMDA receptors
activate more slowly, particularly in
response to waves of multiple action
potentials. Interactions between these
receptors appear to be important in
learning and memory.
GABA is the brain’s most im-
portant inhibitory neurotransmitter.
It binds to two groups of receptors;
one group is ionotropic, the other
metabotropic. Ionotropic GABA
receptors have ion channels that let
negatively charged chloride ions enter
the cell. Metabotropic GABA recep-
tors open ion channels that release
potassium ions. In both instances, ion
movement pushes membrane poten-
tial downward and inhibits a neuron
from firing.


Many different molecules act

as neurotransmitters, and each one

fits into specific receptors like a

key fits a lock.

**Brain Basics 1**

#### RECEPTORS AND

#### MOLECULAR SIGNALING

Neurons have receptors for many
molecules that can change the way
they function. These molecules include
hormones, which send the brain
specific cues about the condition and
activity of distant tissues in the body;
neuromodulators such as the endo-
cannabinoids, cannabis-like chemicals
that seem to suppress neurotransmit-
ter release; and prostaglandins, small
lipids that change the brain’s response
(increasing pain sensitivity) to pain
and inflammation.
Individual neurons have receptors
for different subsets of hormones and
neuromodulators. In each case, these
molecules are signals that trigger a
series of chemical reactions inside the
cell. The process starts when one of
these molecules binds to its specific
receptor. If the receptor is on the
surface of the cell, the bound molecule
changes the receptor’s shape across the
cell membrane and starts a chain of in-
tracellular reactions. This signal trans-
duction pathway ultimately modifies
neuronal function, either by shifting
the cell’s ion balance or by changing
the activity of specific enzymes.
If a molecule can diffuse through
the cell membrane — as occurs with
steroid hormones like estradiol or cor-
tisol — its receptor might be a protein
inside the neuron’s soma. When the
hormone binds to its receptor, the com-
plex can transform into a transcription
factor that is capable of entering the cell
nucleus, binding to specific genes and
changing their activity.

#### NEURONS, GENES,

#### AND GENE EXPRESSION


By this point, it should be clear
that neurons inside the brain can differ
in appearance and function. They can
produce different types of neurotrans-
mitters, determining whether their
signals have excitatory or inhibitory
effects in their circuits. They can have
different assortments of neurotrans-
mitter receptors, determining the cells’
sensitivity to the effects of specific
neurotransmitters. And, in their cell
membranes, neurons possess different
combinations of receptors capable of
detecting neuromodulators that influ-
ence neuronal behavior — for exam-
ple, hormones such as vasopressin,
estradiol, or cortisol.
All cells in your body, including
neurons, contain the same DNA
housing the same genes. Differences
among your neurons result from dif-
ferences in which genes direct cellular
activities, a process called gene expres-
sion. Each cell (or cell type) builds
proteins from a slightly different
subset of genes in its genetic code, the
same way different children will build
different structures from the same
starting set of Lego blocks.
The mechanisms causing neu-
rons to express some genes and not
others are currently an area of intense
research. Many of these mechanisms
depend on chemical changes to
chromatin, the complex of protein
and DNA that compactly packages
the long DNA molecule inside the
nucleus. Genes that a cell is using to
build proteins need to be accessible



and are associated with open, unfolded
chromatin, while unexpressed genes
are typically in tightly packed regions.
Chemical changes that tighten or
spread out chromatin complexes can,
respectively, shut down or activate the
genes on that segment of DNA. These
changes are reversible, giving neurons
flexibility to alter the genes they
express in response to hormonal cues
and environmental changes.
The genes that affect neuron
structure and function can also differ
between individuals. Gene variants
or alleles reflect differences in the
nucleotide sequences that make up
a gene. While different alleles code
for forms of the same protein, the
variants can produce structural dif-
ferences that affect their function. An
allele might code for a version of an
enzyme that is less effective than the
usual version, and specific alleles of
some genes can even cause neurolog-
ical diseases. For example, Tay-Sachs
disease, a fatal degenerative neurolog-
ical condition, is caused by muta-
tions in a gene that codes for part
of a fat-metabolizing enzyme called
beta-hexosaminidase A. Because the
variant enzyme is poor at breaking
down specific fats, these build up in
neurons and become toxic. There
are many cases where small changes
in genetic sequence affect how our
brain can function, and in the next
10 years — with our capacity to se-
quence a person’s entire genome now
possible — we will be able to move
much closer to understanding the
genetic basis of brain disorders.

ou can think of your sense or-
gans as the brain’s windows on
the external world. The world
itself has no actual images, sounds,
tastes, and smells. Instead, you are sur-
rounded by different types of energy
and molecules that must be translated
into perceptions or sensations. For this
extraordinary transformation to work,
your sense organs turn stimuli such
as light waves or food molecules into
electrical signals through the process of
transduction. These electrical messages
are then carried through a network of
cells and fibers to specialized areas of
your brain where they are processed
and integrated into a seamless percep-
tion of your surroundings.



VISION
Vision is one of your most compli-
cated senses, involving many processes
that work simultaneously enabling you
to see what is happening around you.
It is no surprise, then, that the visual
system involves about 30 percent of
humans’ cerebral cortex — more than
any other sense does. Vision has been
studied intensively, and we now know
more about it than any other sensory
system. Knowledge of how light ener-
gy is converted into electrical signals
comes primarily from studies of fruit
flies ( Drosophila ) and mice. Higher-
level visual processing has mostly
been studied in monkeys and cats.
In many ways, seeing with your
eyes is similar to taking pictures with
an old-fashioned camera. Light passes
through the cornea and enters the eye
through the pupil. The iris regulates
how much light enters by changing
the size of the pupil. The lens then
bends the light so that it focuses on
the inner surface of your eyeball, on
a sheet of cells called the retina. The
rigid cornea does the initial focusing,

**Senses & Perception 2**

but the lens can thicken or flatten to
bring near or far objects into better
focus on the retina. Much like a cam-
era capturing images on film, visual
input is mapped directly onto the
retina as a two-dimensional reversed
image. Objects to the right proj-
ect images onto the left side of the
retina and vice versa; objects above
are imaged at the lower part and vice
versa. After processing by specialized
cells in several layers of the retina,
signals travel via the optic nerves to
other parts of your brain and undergo
further integration and interpretation.

**The Three-Layered Retina**
The retina is home to three
types of neurons — photo-
receptors, interneurons, and ganglion
cells — which are organized into
several layers. These cells communicate
extensively with each other before
sending information along to the brain.
Counterintuitively, the light-sensitive
photoreceptors — rods and cones
— are located in the most peripheral
layer of the retina. This means that after
entering through the cornea and lens,
light travels through the ganglion cells
and interneurons before it reaches the
photoreceptors. Ganglion cells and
interneurons do not respond directly to
light, but they process and relay
information from the photoreceptors;
the axons of ganglion cells exit the
retina together, forming the optic nerve.
There are approximately 125
million photoreceptors in each human
eye, and they turn light into electrical
signals. The process of converting one
form of energy into another occurs in
most sensory systems and is known as
transduction. Rods, which make up
about 95 percent of photoreceptors
in humans, are extremely sensitive, al-
lowing you to see in dim light. Cones,


on the other hand, pick up fine detail
and color, allowing you to engage in
activities that require a great deal of
visual acuity. The human eye contains
three types of cones, each sensitive to
a different range of colors (red, green,
or blue). Because their sensitivities
overlap, differing combinations of the
three cones’ activity convey informa-
tion about every color, enabling you
to see the familiar color spectrum. In
that way, your eyes resemble computer
monitors that mix red, green, and blue
levels to generate millions of colors.
Because the center of the retina
contains many more cones than other
retinal areas, vision is sharper here than
in the periphery. In the very center of
the retina is the fovea, a small pitted
area where cones are most densely
packed. The fovea contains only red
and green cones and can resolve very
fine details. The area immediately
around the fovea, the macula, is critical



for reading and driving. In the United
States and other developed countries,
death or degeneration of photoreceptors
in the macula, called macular degener-
ation, is a leading cause of blindness in
people older than 55.
Neurons in each of the three layers
of the retina typically receive inputs
from many cells in the preceding layer,
but the total number of inputs varies
widely across the retina. For example,
in the macular region where visual
acuity is highest, each ganglion cell
receives input (via one or more inter-
neurons) from just one or very few
cones, allowing you to resolve very fine
details. Near the margins of the retina,
however, each ganglion cell receives
signals from several photoreceptor
cells. This convergence of inputs
explains why your peripheral vision
is less detailed. The portion of visual
space providing input to a single gan-
glion cell is called its receptive field.



Here, in the back of the eye, is one of the first stops visual information makes on its way to
the brain. In this image of a mouse retina, axons of nerve cells are labeled in yellow. They
extend through a small opening in the back of the eye — labeled in black — through the
optic nerve to higher vision centers. The axons must penetrate another layer of cells known
as astrocytes, labeled in blue, that provide nutritional support to the retina.

### 20 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**2 Senses & Perception**

**How Is Visual
Information Processed?**
Every time you open your
eyes, you distinguish shapes,
colors, contrasts and the speed and
direction of movements. You can easily
distinguish your coffee mug from the
peanut butter jar in front of you. You
can also tell that the tree outside the
window stands still and the squirrel is
scurrying up the tree (not vice versa).
But how is a simple two-dimensional
retinal image processed to create such
complex imagery?
Visual processing begins with
comparing the amounts of light hit-
ting small, adjacent areas on the retina.
The receptive fields of ganglion cells
“tile” the retina, providing a complete
two-dimensional representation (or
map) of the visual scene. The recep-
tive field of a ganglion cell is activated
when light hits a tiny region on the
retina that corresponds to the center of
its field; it is inhibited when light hits
the donut-shaped area surrounding
the center. If light strikes the entire
receptive field — the donut _and_ its
hole — the ganglion cell responds only
weakly. This center-surround antago-
nism is the first way our visual system
maximizes the perception of contrast,
which is key to object detection.
Neural activity in the axons of
ganglion cells is transmitted via the
optic nerves, which exit the back of
each eye and travel toward the back of
the brain. Because there are no photo-
receptors at this site, the exit point of
the optic nerve results in a small “blind
spot” in each eye, which our brains
fortuitously “fill in” using information
from the other eye. On their way to
the brain, signals travel along nerve
fibers from both eyes which first
converge at a crossover junction called
the optic chiasm. Those fibers carrying


information from the left side of the
retinas of both eyes continue together
on the left side of the brain; informa-
tion from the right side of both retinas
proceeds on the right side of the brain.
Visual information is then relayed
through the lateral geniculate nucleus,
a region of the thalamus, and then to
the primary visual cortex at the rear
of the brain.



Visual Cortex:
Layers, Angles, and Streams
The primary visual cortex, a thin
sheet of neural tissue no larger than a
half-dollar, is located in the occipital
lobe at the back of your brain. Like
the retina, this region consists of many
layers with densely packed cells. The
middle layer, which receives messages
from the thalamus, has receptive fields
similar to those in the retina and can
preserve the retina’s visual map. Cells
above and below the middle layer have
more complex receptive fields, and
they register stimuli shaped like bars or
edges or with particular orientations.
For example, specific cells can respond
to edges at a certain angle or moving in
a particular direction. From these layers



of cells, new processing streams pass
the information along to other parts
of the visual cortex. As visual infor-
mation from the primary visual cortex
is combined in other areas, receptive
fields become increasingly complex and
selective. Some neurons at higher levels
of processing, for example, respond
only to specific objects and faces.
Studies in monkeys suggest that vi-
sual signals are fed into several parallel
but interacting processing streams. Two
of these are the dorsal stream, which
heads up toward the parietal lobe, and
the ventral stream, which heads down
to the temporal lobe. Traditionally,
these streams were believed to carry
out separate processing of unconscious
vision, which guides behavior and
conscious visual experiences. If you see
a dog running out into the street, the
ventral or “What” stream would inte-
grate information about the dog’s shape
and color with memories and experi-
ences that let you recognize the dog as
your neighbor’s. The dorsal or “Where”
stream would combine various spatial
relationships, motion, and timing to
create an action plan, but without a
need for conscious thought. You might



Vision begins with light. The light bouncing off an object passes through the optical lens and
hits the retina at the back of the eye. Receptors in the retina transform light into electrical
signals that carry information to the vision processing centers in the brain.

shout out “Stop!” without thinking.
Ongoing research now questions this
strict division of labor and suggests that
crosstalk between streams may actually
create a conscious experience. Clearly,
in recognizing an image the brain
extracts information at several stages,
compares it with past experiences, and
passes it to higher levels for processing.

**Eyes Come in Pairs**
Seeing with two eyes, called binoc-
ular vision, allows you to perceive depth
or three dimensions, because each eye
sees an object from a slightly different
angle. This only works if the eyes’
visual fields overlap and if both eyes are
equally active and properly aligned. A
person with crossed eyes, a condition
called strabismus, misses out on much
depth perception. Information from
the perspective of each eye is preserved
all the way to the primary visual cortex
where it is processed further. Two eyes
also allow a much larger visual field
to be mapped onto the primary visual
cortex. Because some of the nerve fibers
exiting each eye cross over at the optic
chiasm, signals from the left visual field
end up on the right side of the brain
and vice versa, no matter which eye
the information comes from. A similar
arrangement applies to movement and
touch. Each half of the cerebrum is
responsible for processing information
from the opposite side of the body.

**Treating Visual Disorders**
Many research studies using
animals have provided insights
into treatment of diseases that affect
eyesight. Research with cats and
monkeys has helped us find better
therapies for strabismus. Children with
strabismus initially have good vision in
each eye but, because they cannot fuse
the images coming from both eyes,


they start to favor one eye and often
lose vision in the other. Vision can be
restored in such cases, but only if the
child is treated at a young age; beyond
the age of 8 or so, the blindness
becomes permanent. Until a few
decades ago, ophthalmologists waited
until children were 4 years old before
operating to align the eyes, prescribing
exercises or using an eye patch. Now
strabismus is corrected well before age 4,
when normal vision can still be restored.
Loss of function or death of
photoreceptors appears to lie at the
heart of various disorders that cause
blindness. Unfortunately, many are
difficult to treat. Extensive genetic
studies and the use of model organisms
have identified a variety of genetic
defects that cause people to go blind,
making it possible to design gene or
stem cell therapies that can recover
photoreceptors. Researchers are work-
ing on potential treatments for genetic
blindness, and gene therapies have
already enabled some patients with loss
of central vision (macular degenera-
tion) or other forms of blindness to see
better. Work is also underway to send
electrical signals directly to the brain
via ganglion cells rather than attempt-
ing to restore lost photoreceptors, an
approach very similar to the use of
cochlear implants to treat deafness.



HEARING
Hearing is one of your most
important senses, alerting you to an ap-
proaching car and telling you where it’s
coming from long before it comes into
sight. Hearing is also central to social
interactions. It allows you to communi-
cate with others by processing and inter-
preting complex messages in the form of
speech sounds. Like the visual system,
your hearing (auditory) system picks up
several qualities of the signals it de-



tects, such as a sound’s pitch, loudness,
duration, and location. Your auditory
system analyzes complex sounds, break-
ing them into separate components or
frequencies, as a result, you can follow
particular voices in a conversation or
instruments as you listen to music.



Can You Hear Me Now?
Whether it’s the dreaded alarm in
the morning, the ringtone on your cell
phone, or your favorite jogging music,
hearing involves a series of steps that
convert sound waves in the air into
electrical signals that are carried to the
brain by nerve cells. Sound in the form
of air pressure waves reaches the pin-
nae of your ears, where the waves are
funneled into each ear canal to reach
the eardrum (tympanic membrane).
The eardrum vibrates in response to
these changes in air pressure, send-
ing these vibrations to three tiny,
sound-amplifying bones in the middle
ear: the malleus (hammer), incus (an-
vil), and stapes (stirrup). The last bone
in the chain (the stapes) acts like a tiny
piston, pushing on the oval window,
a membrane that separates the air-
filled middle ear from the fluid-filled,
snail-shell-shaped cochlea of the inner
ear. The oval window converts the
mechanical vibrations of the stapes
into pressure waves in the fluid of the
cochlea, where they are transduced
into electrical signals by specialized
receptor cells (hair cells).



From Pressure
Wave to Electrical Signal
An elastic membrane, called
the basilar membrane, runs
along the inside of the cochlea like a
winding ramp, spiraling from the
outer coil, near the oval window, to
the innermost coil. The basilar mem-
brane is “tuned” along its length to


### 22 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**2 Senses & Perception**

different frequencies (pitches). When
fluid inside the cochlea ripples, the
membrane moves, vibrating to higher-
pitched sounds (like the screech of
audio feedback) near the oval window
and to lower-pitched sounds (like a
bass drum) in the center.
Rows of small sensory hair cells
are located on top of the vibrating
basilar membrane. When the mem-
brane moves up and down, micro-
scopic hair-like stereocilia extending
from the hair cells bend against an
overlying structure called the tectorial
membrane. This bending opens small
channels in the stereocilia that allow
ions in the surrounding fluid to rush
in, converting the physical movement
into an electrochemical signal. Hair
cells stimulated in this way then excite
the auditory nerve, which sends its
electrical signals on to the brainstem.
The next stop for sound process-
ing is the thalamus, the brain’s relay
station for incoming sensory informa-
tion, which then sends the information
into the auditory part of the cerebral
cortex. Several thousand hair cells are
positioned along the length of the bas-
ilar membrane. Each hair cell responds
most strongly to just a narrow range
of sound frequencies, depending on
how far along the cochlea it is located.
Thus, each nerve fiber connecting with
the hair cells is tuned to very specific
frequencies and carries this informa-
tion into the brain.

**Making Sense of Sound**
On the way to the cortex, the
brainstem and thalamus use
the information from both ears to
compute a sound’s direction and
location. The frequency map of the
basilar membrane is maintained
throughout, even in the primary
auditory cortex in the temporal lobe,


where different auditory neurons
respond to different frequencies. Some
cortical neurons, however, respond to
sound qualities such as intensity,
duration, or a change in frequency.
Other neurons are selective for complex
sounds, while still others specialize in
various combinations of tones. At
higher levels, beyond the primary
auditory cortex, neurons are able to
process harmony, rhythm, and melody,
and combine the types of auditory
information into a voice or instrument
that you can recognize.
Although sound is processed on
both sides of the brain, the left side is
typically responsible for understanding
and producing speech. Someone with
damage to the left auditory cortex
(particularly a region called Wernicke’s
area), as from a stroke, is able to hear
a person speak but no longer under-
stands what is being said.



Treating Hearing Loss
Loss of hair cells is responsible for
the majority of cases of hearing loss.
Unfortunately, once they die, hair
cells don’t regrow. Current research is
therefore focusing on how inner ear
structures like hair cells develop and
function, exploring new avenues for
treatment that could eventually involve
neurogenesis with the goal of replacing
damaged hair cells.



TASTE AND SMELL
The senses of taste (gustation) and
smell (olfaction) are closely linked and
help you navigate the chemical world.
Just as sound is the perception of air
pressure waves and sight is the percep-
tion of light, smell and taste are your
perceptions of tiny molecules in the air
and in your food. Both of these senses
contribute to how food tastes, and
both are important to survival, because



Sound waves — vibrations in the air caused by the sound’s source — are picked up by the outer
ear and funneled down the auditory canal to the ear drum. There, the malleus (hammer) transfers
vibrations to the incus (anvil) and then onto the stapes. Hair cells in the cochlea convert the infor-
mation in these vibrations to electrical signals, which are sent to the brain via the cochlear nerve.

they enable people to detect hazardous
substances they might inhale or ingest.
The cells processing taste and smell are
exposed to the outside environment,
leaving them vulnerable to damage.
Because of this, taste receptor cells regu-
larly regenerate, as do olfactory receptor
neurons. In fact, olfactory neurons are
the only sensory neurons that are con-
tinually replaced throughout our lives.

**From Molecules to Taste**
Our ability to taste foods
depends on the molecules set
free when we chew or drink. These
molecules are detected by taste (or
gustatory) cells within taste buds
located on the tongue and along the
roof and back of the mouth. We have
between 5,000 and 10,000 taste buds
but start to lose them around age 50.
Each taste bud consists of 50 to 100
sensory cells that are receptive to one of
at least five basic taste qualities: sweet,
sour, salty, bitter, and umami (Japanese
for “savory”). Contrary to common
belief, all tastes are detected across the
tongue and are not limited to specific
regions. When taste receptor cells are
stimulated, they send signals through
three cranial nerves — the facial,


glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves
— to taste regions in the brainstem.
The impulses are then routed through
the thalamus to the gustatory cortex in
the frontal lobe, and insula where
specific taste perceptions are identified.



From Molecules to Smell
Odors enter the nose on air
currents and bind to special-
ized olfactory cells on a small patch of
mucus membrane high inside the nasal
cavity. Axons of these sensory neurons
enter the two olfactory bulbs (one for
each nostril) after crossing through
tiny holes in the skull. From there, the
information travels to the olfactory
cortex. Smell is the only sensory
system that sends sensory information
directly to the cerebral cortex without
first passing through the thalamus.
We have around 1,000 different
types of olfactory cells, but can iden-
tify about 20 times as many smells.
The tips of olfactory cells are equipped
with several hair-like cilia that are
receptive to a number of different odor
molecules, and many cells respond to
the same molecules. A specific smell
will therefore stimulate a unique
combination of olfactory cells, cre-



ating a distinct activity pattern. This
“signature” pattern of activity is then
transmitted to the olfactory bulb and
on to the primary olfactory cortex
located on the anterior surface of the
temporal lobe. Olfactory information
then passes to nearby brain areas,
where odor and taste information
are mixed, creating the perception of
flavor. Recent research suggests that
people can identify odors as quickly
as 110 milliseconds after their first
sniff. Interestingly, the size of the
olfactory bulbs and the way neurons
are organized can change over time.
As mentioned above, the olfactory
bulbs in rodents and primates (includ-
ing humans) are one of the few brain
regions able to generate new neurons
(neurogenesis) throughout life.



Combining Taste and Smell
Taste and smell are separate senses
with their own receptor organs. Yet,
we notice their close relationship when
our nose is stuffed up by a cold and
everything we eat tastes bland. It seems
like our sense of taste no longer works,
but the actual problem is that we
detect only the taste, not taste and
smell combined. Taste sense itself is
rather crude, distinguishing only five
basic taste qualities, but our sense of
smell adds great complexity to the
flavors we perceive. Human studies
have shown that taste perceptions are
particularly enhanced when people are
exposed to matching combinations of
familiar tastes and smells. For example,
sugar tastes sweeter when combined
with the smell of strawberries, than
when paired with the smell of peanut
butter or no odor at all. Taste and
smell information appear to converge
in several central regions of the brain.
There are also neurons in the inferior
frontal lobe that respond selectively to


Your tongue’s receptors, called taste buds,
transform information about tastes and send
them to the brain to be processed into your
favorite flavors. In this image of a mouse
tongue, the axons that connect to these
receptors are highlighted in red.


The olfactory bulb is a structure in the
forebrain responsible for processing smell
information. This series of images shows
the olfactory bulbs from a zebrafish at
three stages of development.

specific taste and smell combinations.
Some of our sensitivity to taste
and smell is lost as we age, most likely
because damaged receptors and senso-
ry neurons are no longer replaced by
new ones. Current research is getting
closer to understanding how stem cells
give rise to the neurons that mediate
smell or taste. With this knowledge,
stem cell therapies might one day be
used to restore taste or smell to those
who have lost it.

**TOUCH AND PAIN**
The somatosensory system is
responsible for all the touch
sensations we feel. These can include
light touch, pressure, vibration,
temperature, texture, itch, and pain.
We perceive these sensations with
various types of touch receptors whose
nerve endings are located in different
layers of our skin, the body’s main
sense organ for touch. In hairy skin
areas, some particularly sensitive nerve
cell endings wrap around the bases of
hairs, responding to even the slightest
hair movement.
Signals from touch receptors travel
along sensory nerve fibers that connect
to neurons in the spinal cord. From
there, the signals move upward to the
thalamus and on to the somatosen-
sory cortex, where they are translated
into a touch perception. Some touch
information travels quickly along my-
elinated nerve fibers with thick axons
(A-beta fibers), but other information
is transmitted more slowly along thin,
unmyelinated axons (C fibers).

**Cortical Maps
and Sensitivity to Touch**
Somatosensory information from
all parts of your body is spread onto the
cortex in the form of a topographic map
that curls around the brain like head-


phones. Very sensitive body areas like
lips and fingertips stimulate much larger
regions of the cortex than less sensitive
parts of the body. The sensitivity of
different body regions to tactile and
painful stimuli depends largely on the
number of receptors per unit area and
the distance between them. In contrast
to your lips and hands, which are the
most sensitive to touch, touch receptors
on your back are few and far apart,
making your back much less sensitive.
Neurologists measure this sensi-
tivity using two-point discrimination
— the minimum distance between two
points on the skin that a person can
identify as distinct stimuli rather than
a single one. Not surprisingly, acuity is
greatest (and the two-point threshold
is lowest) in the most densely nerve-
packed areas of the body, like the fingers
and lips. By contrast, you can distin-
guish two stimuli on your back only if
they are several centimeters apart.



Pain and Itch Signals
Pain is both a sensory experi-
ence and an emotional experi-
ence. The sensory component signals
tissue damage or the potential for
damage, and the emotional component
makes the experience unpleasant and



distressing. Pain is primarily a warning
signal — a way your brain tells itself
that something is wrong with the body.
Pain occurs when special sensory fibers,
called nociceptors, respond to stimuli
that can cause tissue damage. Normally,
nociceptors respond only to strong or
high-threshold stimuli. This response
helps us detect when something is truly
dangerous. Different types of nocicep-
tors are sensitive to different types of
painful stimuli, such as thermal (heat
or cold), mechanical (wounds), or
chemical (toxins or venoms). Interest-
ingly, these same receptors also respond
to chemicals in spicy food, like the
capsaicin in hot peppers, which might
produce a burning pain, depending on
your sensitivity. Some types of nocicep-
tors respond only to chemical stimuli
that cause itch. A well-known example
is histamine receptors that are activated
when skin irritation, bug bites, and
allergies trigger the release of histamine
inside your body. But scientists have
recently identified other itch-specific
receptors as well.
When tissue injury occurs, it
triggers the release of various chemicals
at the site of damage, causing inflam-
mation. This inflammatory “soup”
then triggers nerve impulses that cause



In this image, sensory nerve fibers, labeled in red, can be seen in the paw of a developing
mouse embryo. These nerve fibers will become specialized to detect either pressure, pain,
temperature, or itch.

you to continue feeling pain, which
helps you protect a damaged part of
the body. Prostaglandins, for example,
enhance the sensitivity of receptors to
tissue damage, making you feel pain
more intensely. They also contribute to
a condition called allodynia, in which
even soft touch can produce pain, as on
badly sunburned skin. A long-lasting
injury may lead to nervous system
changes that enhance and prolong the
perceived pain, even in the absence
of pain stimuli. The resulting state of
hypersensitivity to pain, called neuro-
pathic pain, is caused by a malfunc-
tioning nervous system rather than by
an injury. An example of this condition
is diabetic neuropathy, in which nerves
in the hands or feet are damaged by
prolonged exposure to high blood
sugar and send signals of numbness,
tingling, burning, or aching pain.

**Sending and
Receiving Messages**
Pain and itch messages make their
way to the spinal cord via small A-delta
fibers and even smaller C fibers. The
myelin sheath covering A-delta fibers
helps nerve impulses travel faster, and
these fibers evoke the immediate, sharp,
and easily identified pain produced, for
example, by a pinprick. The unmyelin-
ated C fibers transmit pain messages
more slowly; their nerve endings spread
over a relatively large area and produce
a dull and diffuse ache or pain sensa-
tion whose origin is harder to pinpoint.
Pain and itch signals travel up the
spinal cord through the brainstem and
then to the thalamus (the ascending


pathway). From there, they are relayed
to several areas of the cerebral cortex
that monitor the state of the body and
transform pain and itch messages into
conscious experience. Once aware, the
brain has to opportunity to change
how it responds to these messages.



Pain Management
Why do different people,
when exposed to the same pain
stimulus, experience the pain different-
ly? How itchy or painful something
feels obviously depends on the strength
of the stimulus, but also on a person’s
emotional state and the setting in
which the injury occurs. When pain
messages arrive in the cortex, the brain
can process them in different ways.
The cortex sends pain messages to a
region of the brainstem called the
periaqueductal gray matter. Through
its connections with other brainstem
nuclei, the periaqueductal gray matter
activates descending pathways that
modulate pain. These pathways also
send messages to networks that release
endorphins — opioids produced by
the body that act like the analgesic
morphine. Adrenaline produced in
emotionally stressful situations like a
car accident also works as an analgesic
— a drug that relieves pain without a
loss of consciousness. The body’s
release of these chemicals helps
regulate and reduce pain by intercept-
ing the pain signals ascending in the
spinal cord and brainstem.
Although these brain circuits exist
in everyone, their efficacy and sensi-
tivity will influence how much pain



a person feels. They also explain why
some people develop chronic pain that
does not respond to regular treatment.
Research shows that endorphins act at
multiple types of opioid receptors in
the brain and spinal cord, which has
important implications for pain ther-
apy, especially for people who suffer
from intense chronic pain. For exam-
ple, opioid drugs can now be delivered
to the spinal cord before, during, and
after surgery to reduce pain. And
scientists are studying ways to elec-
trically stimulate the spinal cord to
relieve pain while avoiding the po-
tentially harmful effects of long-term
opioid use. Variations in people’s
perceptions of pain also suggest ave-
nues of research for treatments that are
tailored to individual patients.
It is now clear that no single brain
area is responsible for the perception of
pain and itch. Emotional and sensory
components create a mosaic of activity
that influences how we perceive pain.
In fact, some treatment methods —
such as meditation, hypnosis, massag-
es, cognitive behavioral therapy, and
the controlled use of cannabis — have
successfully targeted the emotional
component rather than stopping the
painful stimulus itself. Patients with
chronic pain still feel the pain, but it
no longer “hurts” as much. We don’t
fully understand how these therapies
work, but brain imaging tools have
revealed that cannabis, for example,
suppresses activity in only a few pain
areas in the brain, primarily those that
are part of the limbic system, the
emotional center of the brain.


**H**


ave you ever marveled at
the athleticism of a tennis
player as she lands a perfect
serve, or the virtuosity of a pianist
whose fingers dance through a piece
by Rachmaninoff? These are special
and dramatic movements. Yet in our
daily lives, each of us performs a
suite of complex, skilled movements
that are equally remarkable — from
walking and talking, to signing our
names, or sending a text. We even
use our muscles to reveal our current
mood: A smile and a wave are univer-
sally understood.
Movement is such an integral
part of our day-to-day experience that
we take for granted the sophisticat-
ed systems that make these actions
possible. The central nervous system
— brain and spinal cord — directs the
coordinated actions of the hundreds of
muscles that enable us to move. These
actions are refined and strengthened as
we make our way through the world,
adapting to changing circumstances
and practicing, sometimes even im-
proving, our motor skills.



VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS
To understand how the
nervous system governs
motion, we begin with the muscles,
the structures of the body that
produce movement. Most muscles
attach to the skeleton and span
joints, the sites where two or more
bones come together. The close
relationship of these muscles to the
skeleton gives them their name —
skeletal muscles. Activating muscles
can either flex or extend the joint
that they span. Muscles that bend a
joint, bringing the bones closer
together, are called flexors; muscles
that straighten the joint, increasing
the angle between the bones, are

**Movement 3**

called extensors. Flexors and exten-
sors work in opposition, so when one
set of muscles contracts, the other
relaxes. For example, bending the
elbow requires contraction of the
biceps (a flexor) and relaxation of the
triceps (an extensor). For such
motions, the muscles that promote
the movement are called agonists,
and those that oppose or inhibit the
movement are antagonists. Skilled,
rapid movements — like throwing a
dart — are started by agonists and
stopped by antagonists, allowing the
limb to accelerate and halt with great
speed and precision. For some move-
ments, agonists and their opposing
antagonists contract at the same time,
which is called co-contraction. These
simultaneous actions can stabilize or
control a movement, such as holding
an object at arm’s length or stabiliz-
ing an immobile joint during
isometric exercises.
Whether flexion or extension,
the movement of all skeletal muscles
is controlled by the central nervous
system. A skeletal muscle is made
up of thousands of individual mus-
cle cells, called muscle fibers. Each
muscle fiber is controlled by a single
alpha motor neuron that originates in
the spinal cord or the brain. However,
each of these alpha motor neurons
can control multiple muscle fibers
(from a few to 100 or more). An al-
pha motor neuron plus all the muscle
fibers it controls form a functional
unit known as a motor unit, the crit-
ical link between the central nervous
system and skeletal muscles. When
motor neurons die — as happens in
diseases like amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) — people can lose
their ability to move.
Some muscles act not on joints but
on soft tissue. For example, muscles


The nervous system is divided in two. The central nervous system consists of the brain and
spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves and small concentrations of
gray matter called ganglia. The brain sends messages to the peripheral nerves, which control
the muscles and internal organs.

in the head and neck enable us to
move our eyes, chew and swallow
food, have conversations, and control
our facial expressions. These muscles
are also controlled by the central
nervous system, and they operate
in much the same way as those that
attach to bones.



INVOLUNTARY
MOVEMENTS
Many types of movement take
place without our conscious
control. Among the simplest and most
fundamental types of involuntary
movements are the reflexes. Reflexes
are relatively stereotyped, automatic
muscle responses to particular stimuli
— think of the rapid withdrawal of
your hand after touching something
hot. These reflexes involve the activa-
tion of sensory receptors in the skin,
the joints, or even in the muscles
themselves. The responses are rapid
and occur without involvement of the
brain or conscious attention. Instead,
they depend on circuits of neurons
located in or near the spinal
cord itself.
One of the best-known reflexes
is the “knee jerk” response, a stretch
(myotatic) reflex that occurs when
a physician strikes the tendon just
below the knee with a small rubber
hammer. This tap produces a slight
stretch of the knee extensor muscle,
which is “sensed” by receptors within
the muscle called muscle spindles.
The spindles sense the extent and
speed of the stretch, and stimu-
late sensory neurons, which send a
barrage of impulses into the spinal
cord. There, the signals activate the
alpha motor neurons that cause the
stretched extensor muscle to contract,
triggering the reflex. Of course, for
the leg to kick forward, the antagonist


The stretch reflex, as seen at top of the image, occurs when a doctor taps a muscle tendon
to test your reflexes. This activates muscle spindle sensory fibers, which send a barrage of
impulses to the spinal cord, activating motor neurons and triggering muscle contraction.
Flexion withdrawal, shown on the bottom of this image, occurs when you step on a sharp
object, and your leg is immediately lifted (flexion) from the source of potential injury.
The opposite leg responds with increased extension so that you can maintain your balance,
called the crossed extension reflex.

### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 29

**Movement 3**

flexor muscle has to relax at the same
time. In fact, the same sensory stim-
ulus that directly activates the motor
neurons controlling the extensor also
indirectly inhibits the motor neurons
controlling the antagonist flexor. This
reciprocal inhibition is accomplished
by connecting neurons that lie com-
pletely within the spinal cord. When
these so-called inhibitory interneu-
rons are activated by the original sen-
sory stimulus, they send impulses that
inhibit the motor neurons supplying
the flexor.
Thus, even the simplest of reflexes
involves the synchronous activation
(and inactivation) of multiple sets of
motor neurons controlling both ago-
nist and antagonist muscles.
Many reflexes protect you from


injury. When you’re seated in a doc-
tor’s office, the “knee jerk” reflex sim-
ply makes your lower leg swing briefly
forward. However, if you were to
jump off a chair (or perform an even
more dramatic gymnastic dismount)
this same reflex would promote the
contraction of the strong muscles that
straighten your knees, helping you to
“stick your landing” and remain up-
right. Another protective reflex is the
flexion withdrawal reflex that occurs
when your bare foot encounters a
sharp object. In this case, pain recep-
tors in the skin send a message to the
spinal cord, alpha motor neurons are
activated, and the leg is immediately
lifted (flexion). At the same time,
because your body weight is support-
ed on both legs, the extensors of the



opposite leg must be activated. With-
out this additional reaction, called the
flexion crossed extension reflex, you
would lose your balance and fall over
after stepping on a tack.
As all these movements occur, the
muscles involved provide feedback
to the brain with information about
where the various body parts are in
space and how fast they are moving.
The muscle spindles mentioned earli-
er supply information about changes
in muscle length or stretch. The
brain, in turn, adjusts the sensitivity
of the system via a separate set of mo-
tor neurons, gamma motor neurons,
which keep the muscle spindles taut.

Golgi tendon organs — located where
the muscle fibers connect to the

tendon — detect how much force or
tension is applied to a muscle during
ongoing movement, increasing the
movement’s precision. These feedback
systems are not unique to reflexes,
but allow the brain to fine-tune how
working muscles behave during a
variety of movement tasks — from

those that require a mastery of del-
icate positioning and coordination,
such as sipping from a dangerously
full teacup, to those that involve a
targeted application of strength and
speed, such as throwing a runner out
at first base.

**VOLUNTARY AND
COMPLEX MOVEMENTS**
Spinal circuits also play a critical
role in controlling more sophisti-
cated, voluntary behaviors, such as
the alternating action of the legs
during walking. In fact, the rhythmic
patterns of muscle activation that
produce locomotion — not only in
four-footed animals, but in humans
— are generated by neurons within
spinal cord and brainstem circuits.
When these neuronal circuits (central
pattern generators) are activated, they
produce the rhythmic patterns that


occur in walking, flying, swimming,
or breathing. Central pattern genera-
tors which evolved in primitive verte-
brates, are being studied to determine
the degree to which spinal circuitry
can be co-opted to recover basic
postural and locomotor function after
severe paralysis.



The most complex movements
that you perform, including those
requiring conscious planning, involve
input from the brain. These higher
brain regions initiate voluntary mo-
tion, coordinate complex sequences of
movement, and tailor behavioral out-
put to suit a given situation. Successful
execution of these programs requires
your brain to relay commands to the
appropriate spinal circuits.
Through careful animal experi-
ments, scientists are just beginning
to understand the coordinated series
of interactions that take place among
different brain regions during vol-
untary movement. One brain area
essential for voluntary movement
is the motor cortex. Neurons in the
motor cortex send signals that directly
control the activation of alpha motor
neurons in the spine. Some of these
cortical neurons control the move-



ment of functionally related muscles
in an individual body part, such as
your hand or arm; such neurons are
important for finely tuned motor
skills. Other neurons in the motor
cortex can direct the coordinated
movement of a limb to a particular
point in space — raising your arm
in a defensive position or bringing a
hand to your mouth to deliver a tasty
morsel of food.



Regions that Modulate
Voluntary Movement
The motor cortex does not
act alone in controlling
complex or skilled voluntary move-
ments. Several other brain regions
participate in parallel circuits or
“loops” to modulate motor control.
These regions — including the basal
ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and a
large number of neuron groups
located within the midbrain and
brainstem — also influence the
activity of motor neurons in the
spinal cord. The basal ganglia them-
selves encompass two separate path-
ways. One appears to facilitate the
desired motor program while the
other suppresses unwanted, compet-
ing actions. Along with the thalamus,
the basal ganglia share widespread
connections with motor and sensory
areas of the cerebral cortex, allowing
these structures to monitor and adjust
motor performance.
Dysfunction of the basal gan-
glia can lead to serious movement
disorders. People with Parkinson’s
disease experience degeneration of
neurons in a brain region called the
substantia nigra; these neurons relay
signals to the basal ganglia using the
neurotransmitter dopamine, a key
chemical involved in motor con-
trol. Depletion of dopamine gives

rise to the hallmark symptoms of
Parkinson’s: tremor, rigidity, and in
some cases, akinesia, an inability to
move. In contrast, individuals with
Huntington’s disease often display
uncontrolled jerking or twitching
movements, particularly in the face
and extremities. These symptoms
stem from a selective loss of inhibito-
ry neurons in the basal ganglia, which
eliminates the suppression of random
involuntary movements.
Another brain region crucial for


coordinating and fine-tuning skilled
movement is the cerebellum. The
cerebellum receives direct input from
sensory receptors in the limbs and
head, as well as most areas of the cere-
bral cortex. Neurons in the cerebellum
apparently integrate this sensory in-
formation ensuring the proper timing
and integration of muscle action. This
enables us to produce fluid move-
ments more or less automatically. The
cerebellum is essential to a wide range
of motor learning and coordination,



from controlling limb movements to
eye movement to grip force.
Disturbance of cerebellar function
leads to poor coordination, disor-
ders of balance, and even difficulties
in speech, one of the most intricate
forms of movement control. Long-
term alcohol abuse is a common cause
of acquired cerebellar degeneration.
Typical symptoms are poor coordina-
tion, an unsteady walk or stumbling
gait, changes in speech, and difficulty
with fine motor skills including eating,
writing, and dressing.
The cerebellum also allows you
to adapt to the unexpected, adjust-
ing your movements so that you can
smoothly lift a box that you expected
to be much heavier, for example.
And, it plays a major role in motor
learning. As you learned to walk or
speak or practiced a musical instru-
ment or a new dance routine, the
cerebellum refined and sharpened the
motor programs that allow you to
perform these tasks with increasing
accuracy and skill.
Considerable evidence also
indicates that the cerebellum helps us
recalibrate our movements as our
own bodies change, as we grow taller,
gain or lose weight or muscle mass,
or cope with disease or disability. In
that way, the cerebellum facilitates
skillful movement through an
ever-changing world as we grow up
and we grow old.


The cerebellum, shown in this image of a mouse brain, is a region at the back of the brain
associated with movement.

patient known for most of five
decades only by his initials,
H.M., led to one of the most
significant turning points in 20th cen-
tury brain science: the understanding
that complex functions such as learning
and memory are tied to distinct biolog-
ical processes and regions of the brain.
Following a childhood blow to
the head, Henry Molaison developed
severe seizures. Eighteen years later,
still experiencing debilitating symp-
toms, he underwent an experimental
procedure that removed sections of
his medial temporal lobes — includ-
ing most of his two hippocampi. The
seizures abated, but Molaison was left
with permanent amnesia. He could
remember scenes from his childhood,
some facts about his parents, and his-
torical events that occurred before his
surgery, but was unable to form new
conscious memories.
For example, if Molaison met
someone who then left the room,
within minutes he had no recollection
of the person or their meeting. He
experienced every aspect of his daily
life — eating a meal, taking a walk —
as a first. Yet his intellect, personality,
and perception were intact, and he
was able to acquire new motor skills.
Over time, he became more proficient
at tasks such as tracing patterns while
watching his hand movements in a
mirror, despite the fact that he could
never recall performing the task before.
Studied by neuroscientists for 50
years, until his death in 2008 at age
82, Molaison’s intact abilities as well
as his impairments provided evidence
for the roles of the hippocampus and
parahippocampal region in converting
memories from short-term to long-
term, paving the way for further ex-
ploration of brain networks encoding
conscious and unconscious memories.

about the mechanisms, limits, and
architecture of memory formation.
Thanks in part to H.M., scientists
now know that the medial temporal
lobe, which includes the hippocampus
and parahippocampal regions, works
with other regions of the cerebral
cortex, the brain’s outermost layer, to
form, organize, consolidate, and retrieve
memories. The four major lobes of the
cerebral cortex — frontal, parietal, tem-
poral, and occipital — process sensory
information such as smell, taste, sight,
and sound. Associative regions in the
cortex integrate these sensory inputs,
enabling us to understand our environ-
ment and encode memories.

**Declarative Memory**
Declarative memory is memory for
facts, data, and events. Such conscious
(explicit) memories are called declarative
memories because you can consciously
recall and describe the information.
Declarative memories can be semantic
or episodic. Semantic memories consist
of the cultural knowledge, ideas, and
concepts you’ve accumulated about the
world — for example, names of state
capitals, word definitions, how to add
and subtract, or dates of historical events
and their meaning. This type of memory
involves cortical regions well beyond the
hippocampus. Episodic memories are
unique representations of your person-
al experiences. For example, mentally
recalling the sights, sounds, time, space,
and emotions associated with an experi-
ence involves episodic memory.
Interestingly, the emotional signif-
icance attached to memories of events
and experiences is mediated by the


There are several different kinds of memory, and they are processed by different areas of the
brain. The hippocampus, parahippocampal region, and areas of the cerebral cortex work in
tandem to produce memories of facts and events. Other kinds of memories, such as emotion-
al or behavioral memories, are handled by other parts of the brain, including the amygdala,
striatum, and cerebellum.



The dentate gyrus, a portion of the hippocampus responsible for memories of events, is one
of the few areas of the adult brain where neurogenesis takes place. This image of a mouse
dentate gyrus shows newborn cells, labeled in blue, along with the support cells called glia,
labeled in red, that will help them migrate to their final destinations. Some of these new cells
will mature to become different types of neurons in the dentate gyrus, where they will play
important roles in learning and memory.

amygdala. A paired structure consist-
ing of two almond-shaped regions
(amygdala comes from the Greek word
for almond), the amygdala modulates
“fight-or-flight” responses linked to
survival. The parahippocampal region
also aids the hippocampus in encoding
the “what” of episodic memories, rath-
er than the “where” or “when.”
The type of memory described so
far is the long-term form of declarative

memory. Such memories are stored
throughout a broad network of cortical
areas. H.M. was able to retrieve his
previous long-term memories, but not
able to form new ones.
In contrast, working memory is a
temporary type of declarative memory,
a form of short-term memory that lets
you hold a phone number, a sum, a vi-
sual image, or other data point needed
in the present and immediate future.
While the brain seems to possess un-
limited capacity for long-term memo-
ries, short-term memories are limited
to relatively small amounts of data
for a limited amount of time. These
data are accessible while they’re being
processed and manipulated but, unless
transferred to long-term memory, they
decay after only a few seconds and can


no longer be retrieved.
Some aspects of working mem-
ory are coordinated by the prefrontal
cortex (PFC), the “brain’s executive,”
which also controls attention, deci-
sion-making, and long-term planning.
Specific areas of the PFC monitor
information from long-term memory
as well as coordinating working mem-
ory from multiple brain regions. Brain
imaging studies demonstrate the PFC



is particularly active when people con-
centrate on keeping something like a
phone number in mind. Animal stud-
ies suggest that neurons in the PFC fire
in spurts, keeping information active
or “online” in working memory. H.M.
did not lose this type of memory.
Spatial memory is another facet of
declarative memory. This was identified
in studies showing that discrete areas,
and even individual neurons within
the brain, are dedicated to processing
specific types of information. For exam-
ple, navigational memories involved in
creating mental maps are tied to specific
types of neurons. So-called “place cells”
in the hippocampus light up as you
move through a familiar house or room,
or as a rat navigates a known maze.
Studies have also shown that mice navi-



gating a maze display specific sequences
of neuronal activity devoted to right
or left turns. These patterns become
increasingly distinct as the animals learn
the maze. Studies have even shown that
learning complex navigational routes
causes changes in the hippocampus.
“Grid cells,” don’t represent
particular locations. Located in the
entorhinal cortex, an area near the
hippocampus, they represent coor-
dinates that allow the brain to track
your position in space when land-
marks or external cues are absent.



Nondeclarative Memory
Nondeclarative memory — also
known as implicit or procedural mem-
ory — is stored and retrieved without
conscious effort. You use this type of
memory when you perform learned
motor skills like speaking or riding a
bike. H.M. did not lose this type of
memory, as evident in his ability to ac-
quire new motor skills, even though he
couldn’t remember doing them before.
The fact that H.M. (and other
people with amnesia) show deficits in
some types of memory but not others
indicates that different types of memo-
ries are encoded in separate, but inter-
acting, regions of the brain. Motor skill
learning, for example, involves many
areas of the brain, but three are espe-
cially important: the basal ganglia —
the “habit center” of the brain — the
prefrontal cortex, and the cerebellum,
an area at the back of the brain involved
in motor control and coordination.



Storing Memories in
Your Synapses
Your brain is able to
form memories and
rewire itself in response to experience
because circuits in your brain change
at synapses — the tiny gaps across


The brain seems to have unlimited

capacity for long-term memories, but

short-term memories are limited to

small sums of data for a limited time.

which neurons communicate via
chemical and electrical signals. The
ability of synapses to remodel them-
selves is called synaptic plasticity.
Encoding a new long-term memory
involves persistent changes in the
number and shape of synapses, as
well as the amount of neurotransmit-
ter released and the number of recep-
tors on the postsynaptic membrane.
In transmitting information from
one neuron to another, a presynaptic
(sending) neuron transforms an electri-
cal signal into the release of chemical
messengers called neurotransmitters
that diffuse across the synaptic gap to
the postsynaptic (receiving) neuron.
The membrane of the postsynap-
tic neuron contains proteins called
receptors that interact with neurotrans-
mitters. Upon binding the neurotrans-
mitters, the receptors unleash a cascade
of molecular events that convert the
message back into an electrical sig-
nal. The receptors then release the
neurotransmitters, which are recycled
back into the presynaptic terminal or
broken down enzymatically, allowing
postsynaptic receptors to receive new
signals from the presynaptic neuron.
Scientists have learned a great deal
about the ways presynaptic and post-
synaptic neurons remodel themselves.
The sea slug, _Aplysia californica_ , was an
important animal model for the first
neuroscientists studying synaptic plastici-
ty because its nerve cells are relatively few
and easy to observe. Researchers iden-
tified chemical and structural changes
in relevant nerve cells of _Aplysia_ that
correlated with simple forms of learning
and memory. Studies in genetically mod-
ified mice have revealed that alterations
in gene expression facilitate long-term
changes in synaptic structure. Genes
governing a type of glutamate receptor
— N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)


receptors — and a molecule called
cAMP-response element binding protein
(CREB) are especially important in the
formation of long-term memories.
Two opposing but equal pro-
cesses are key for synaptic plasticity:
long-term potentiation (LTP) and
long-term depression (LTD). LTP
is a long-lasting increase in synaptic
strength, which occurs in many brain
regions but especially in the hippo-
campus. LTD, conversely, decreases
a synapse’s effectiveness. Experience
physically changes our brains through
LTP, shown in numerous animal and
human studies to be essential for long-
term memory consolidation.
While LTP has been identified
throughout the brain, it has been stud-
ied extensively in the hippocampus, the
brain region associated with encoding
new memories. The precise mechanism
of LTP varies depending on the type
of neurons, but, in general, it involves
an increase in the number of glutamate
receptors on the postsynaptic neu-
ron. Glutamate is the most prevalent
neurotransmitter in the mammalian
nervous system, and it binds to
several different kinds of receptors.
The NMDA and AMPA (α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid) classes of glutamate receptors are
ion channels. Upon binding gluta-
mate, they permit calcium and sodium
ions, respectively, to flow into the cell.
Increasing the number of receptors
on the postsynaptic cell strengthens a
synapse by allowing the entry of more
electrically conductive ions.
Calcium ions also function as sec-
ond messengers — signaling molecules
that set off a chain of molecular events
within cells. LTP boosts the concentra-
tion of calcium ions inside a postsynap-
tic cell, while LTD increases it to a lesser
degree. The differing concentrations



of calcium activate different enzymes:
kinase proteins in the case of LTP, or
phosphatases for LTD. These enzymes
modify the synapse, making it more or
less efficient at relaying nerve impulses.
In LTP, a series of molecular events
stabilizes the synaptic changes: The in-
crease in calcium ions within the post-
synaptic cell activates cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) molecules.
This, in turn, activates several kinds of
enzymes, some of which increase the
number of synaptic receptors, making
the synapse more sensitive to neu-
rotransmitters. In addition, continued
stimulation through repetitive expe-
rience activates CREB. CREB acts in
the nucleus of the neuron to switch
on a series of genes, many of which
direct protein synthesis. Among the
many proteins produced are neurotro-
phins, which stimulate the growth of
the synapse and structural elements,
stabilizing increased sensitivity
to neurotransmitters.
The preceding molecular cascade
is essential for memories to become
long-term. The prevailing view is that
declarative memories are encoded in
the hippocampus, then transferred to
the frontal lobes for long-term storage
and consolidation. Research suggests
that, over time, the hippocampus
becomes less important for retrieving
older memories as the frontal cortex
assumes that task.
As researchers gain new insights
into the molecular mechanisms un-
derlying memory, pharmaceutical and
technological advances may enable arti-
ficial manipulation of synaptic plastici-
ty. New treatments could be developed
for synapse-related neurological disor-
ders — such as eradication of harmful
memories tied to post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) — or for boosting
our ability to learn and remember.

**4 Learning, Memory & Emotions**

#### EMOTIONS


In emotional memory,
considered another type of
nondeclarative memory, learned
emotional responses become attached
to stimuli over time after repeated
exposure. In the 1970s, anthropologist
Paul Ekman identified what he called
the six basic emotions: anger, fear,
surprise, disgust, joy, and sadness.
While scientists have since disputed
the exact number and attributes
of human emotions, whether emotions
are consistent across cultures,
or even how to define an emotion,
their research has linked some
neural circuits to physiological re-
sponses that help us survive, interact,
set goals, and initiate actions.



Anatomy of Emotion
The brain structures most closely
linked with emotions are the amyg-
dala, the insula or insular cortex,
and the periaqueductal gray, located
in the midbrain. Neurons from the
prefrontal cortex, the amygdala,
and the insular cortex project to the
periaqueductal gray, which in turn
has reciprocal connections with the
central nucleus of the amygdala and
projections to the thalamus, hypothal-
amus, brainstem, and deep layers of
the spinal cord.
The amygdala integrates emo-
tions, emotional behavior, and
motivation. It interprets fear, helps
distinguish friends from foes, and
identifies social rewards and how to



attain them. One very familiar type of
learning is dependent on the amyg-
dala: classical conditioning, which
associates a stimulus with reward
or punishment.
Through the insula, you expe-
rience disgust — a strong negative
reaction to an unpleasant odor, for
instance — that might protect you
from ingesting poison or spoiled food.
The insula has also been implicated
in feeling and anticipating pain, al-
though its exact function in this arena
is not well understood. The insula is
believed to take in system-wide inputs
and generate subjective feelings about
them; thus linking feelings, internal
physiological states, social emotions,
and conscious actions.



Oxytocin is a brain chemical closely associated with love. In order to study something as unique as love, researchers look at the brains of
prairie voles, which mate for life. In this image, oxytocin receptors are labeled in light blue, red, and yellow. When researchers increased
oxytocin receptor levels in the brain (right column), they found female voles formed partner preferences faster.


_Ross, et al. The Journal of Neuroscience, 2009._

### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 37

**Learning, Memory & Emotions 4**

The periaqueductal gray, located
in a region where incoming sensory
information is acted on by higher
brain centers, has been tied to pain
perception as well as stress responses
including defensive and reproductive
behaviors, maternal attachment, and
anxiety. Receptors for pain-reducing
compounds such as morphine and
oxycodone are clustered in the
periaqueductal gray.

**Motivation: Affective
Decision-Making**
Human actions are driven by
necessities — food, sleep, sex, avoid-
ance of pain — and by rewards, but
our responses and actions are not
always logical. While little is known
about exactly how the brain transforms
feelings into decisions, researchers have
developed theoretical models about
decision-making. Affective decision-
making involves choices under risky
and uncertain conditions. An active
area of neuroscience research is inves-
tigating how the brain balances reward
and risk, and how emotional state
affects this balance.
Emotionally centered decision-
making changes with age — possibly
because the lateral prefrontal cortex,
responsible for self-regulation, ma-
tures gradually in adolescents. Teens’
developing brains and high sensitivity
to peer acceptance might be related to
their increased tolerance for risky be-
haviors. Older adults might also make
more risky decisions, as PFC function
diminishes with age.


Motivation: Dopamine
and Reward Pathways
Although relatively few neurons
in the mammalian central nervous
system generate the neurotransmitter
dopamine, these dopaminergic neu-
rons influence multiple brain func-
tions including voluntary movement
and a variety of behavioral processes
such as mood, reward, addiction,
stress and memory.
When something is very rewarding,
we are more likely to remember it. That
is because dopamine influences the syn-
apses in the entire reward pathway —
the hippocampus, amydgala, and the
prefrontal cortex — to create emotional
associations with rewards. And the me-
solimbic pathway, sometimes called the
“reward pathway,” is a major pathway
for dopamine, connecting the mid-
brain’s ventral tegmental area (VTA) to
the nucleus accumbens. It is involved
in cognitive processing of rewards and
motivation. Neurons that release dopa-
mine are activated in response to signals
that a reward will be given.
Surprisingly, it’s not the reward
itself, but the expectation of a reward
that most powerfully influences the
emotional reaction. Reward learning
occurs in response to something un-
expected — when the actual reward
differs from what was predicted. If
a reward is greater than anticipated,
dopamine signaling increases. If a
reward is less than expected, dopa-
mine signaling decreases. In contrast,
a correctly predicted reward does not
elicit changes in dopamine signaling,



and all remains the same.
Interestingly, recent research
shows that dopaminergic responses
vary among people. Some people’s
brains respond more strongly to re-
wards than punishments, while others
respond more strongly to punish-
ments. The amygdala has been im-
plicated in various aspects of reward
learning and motivation. Researchers
at Vanderbilt University found that
“go-getters” who are more willing to
work hard have greater dopamine sig-
naling in the striatum and prefrontal
cortex — two areas known to impact
motivation and reward.
While the brain’s reward system
typically reinforces behaviors associat-
ed with rewards and prevents behav-
iors leading to punishment, aberrant
circuitry can lead to inappropriate
aggression, a symptom of some neu-
ropsychiatric disorders. For example,
the lateral habenula, a major node in
the reward circuitry, appears to en-
code punishment by inhibiting dopa-
mine release, and dysfunction of the
lateral habenula has been linked to
disorders involving inappropriate ag-
gression. The amygdala has also been
associated with negative emotions.
Stimulating some areas can trigger
rage and aggression, while removing
specific sections of the amygdala will
make lab animals more docile. Recent
studies in lab animals have also sug-
gested that aggression can result from
inappropriate activation of the brain’s
reward systems in response to violent
social stimuli.


**F**


rom the moment you wake up,
your brain is bombarded by
stimuli: the sound of birds sing-
ing or the rumble of trucks, the smell
of coffee, the brightness and warmth
of sunlight streaming through your
window. Fortunately, your brain is adept
at filtering this flood of information and
making a decision about what actions to
take. Is it a workday or a weekend? What
would taste good for breakfast? How
warm a sweater do you need? Every mo-
ment you’re conscious, you are thinking,
planning, and making decisions.
But how do you think? What is
happening in our brains when we re-
flect on last night’s party or puzzle over
what to wear today? Can other animals
think the way that humans do? In
order to think, your brain has to
make sense of the noisy, chaotic world
around you. The first filter for that
information is your perception, which
arises from the senses whose processing
we considered in Chapter 2. The next
step is interpreting those perceptions,
which your brain does by comparing
them to memories of past experiences
and observations.



Constructing Representations
Because your brain’s capacity to
store this information in short-term
memory is limited, it builds fairly sim-
ple representations of people, places,
objects, and events as references. To
really make sense of our moment-to-
moment perceptions, the brain relies
on its complex network of associations
assembled from prior experience. These
connections enable your brain to deal
with variable perceptions. For example,
you can identify a dog even if it is a
different breed or color than any you
have seen before. A bicycle still registers
as a bicycle, even if it is obscured so
that only one wheel is visible.

**Thinking, Planning & Language 5**

Constructing these representations
relies on semantic memory, a form of
declarative knowledge that includes
general facts and data. Scientists are just
beginning to understand the nature and
organization of cortical areas involved
in semantic memory, but it appears that
specific cortical networks are specialized
for processing certain types of infor-
mation. Studies using functional brain
imaging have revealed regions of the
cortex that selectively process different
categories of information such as ani-
mals, faces, tools, or words.
Recordings of the electrical
activity of individual brain cells show
that specific, single cells may fire when
someone looks at photographs of a
particular person, but remain quiet
when viewing photographs of other
people, animals, or objects. So-called
“concept cells” work together in assem-
blies. For example, the cells encoding
the concepts of needle, thread, sewing,
and button may be interconnected.
Such cells, and their connections, form
the basis of our semantic memory.
Concept cells reside in the tem-
poral lobe, a brain area that specializes
in object recognition. Scientists made
great strides in understanding memory
by studying H.M., a man with severe
amnesia, who was discussed in Chap-
ter 4. Similarly, our understanding
of thinking and language has been
informed by studying people with
unique deficits caused by particular
patterns of brain damage.
Consider the case of D.B.O., a
72-year old man who suffered multiple
strokes. In tests run by researchers,
D.B.O. could identify only 1 out of
20 different common objects by sight.
He also struggled when he was asked
to take a cup and fill it with water
from the sink. He approached several
different objects — a microwave, water


pitcher, garbage can, and roll of paper
towels — saying “This is a sink ...
Oh! This one could be a sink ... This
is also a sink,” before finally finding
the real sink and filling the cup. But
in striking contrast, he could easily
identify objects when he closed his
eyes and felt them; he could also name
things that he heard, such as a rooster’s
“cock-a-doodle-doo.”
Researchers concluded that
D.B.O.’s strokes had damaged his
brain in ways that prevented visual
input from being conveyed to anterior
temporal regions where semantic pro-
cessing occurs. This blocked his access
to the names of objects that he could
see, but not his ability to name objects
he could touch.



Regional Specialization
and Organization
Experts have learned from people
like D.B.O. that damage to certain
areas of the temporal lobes leads to
problems with recognizing and iden-
tifying visual stimuli. This condition,
called agnosia, occurs in several forms,
depending on the exact location of the
brain damage.
One such region is the fusiform
face area (FFA). Located on the un-
derside of the temporal lobe, the FFA
is critical for recognizing faces. This
distinct area responds more strongly to
images with than without faces, and
bilateral damage to this area results
in prosopagnosia or “face blindness.”
Similarly, a nearby region called the
parahippocampal place area responds
to specific locations, such as pictures of
buildings or particular scenes. Other
areas are activated only by viewing
certain inanimate objects, body parts,
or sequences of letters.
Within these brain areas, infor-
mation is organized into hierarchies,



as complex skills and representations
are built up by integrating information
from simpler inputs. One example of
this organization is the way the brain
represents words. Regions that encode
words include the posterior parietal
cortex, parts of the temporal lobe, and
regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
Together, these areas form the seman-
tic system, a constellation that re-
sponds more strongly to words than to
other sounds, and even more strongly
to natural speech than to artificially
garbled speech. The semantic system
occupies a significant portion of the
human brain, especially compared
to the brains of other primates. This
difference might help explain humans’
unique ability to use language.
Separate areas within this system
encode representations of concrete or
abstract concepts, action verbs, or so-
cial information. Words related to each
other, such as “month” and “week,”
tend to activate the same areas, where-
as unrelated words, such as “month”
and “tall,” are processed in separate
areas of the brain. Many studies using
a technique called functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure
brain activity in response to words
have found more extensive activation
in the left hemisphere, compared to
the right hemisphere. However, when
words are presented in a narrative or
other context, they elicit fMRI activity
on both sides of the brain.
Written language involves addi-
tional brain areas. The visual word
form area (VWFA) in the fusiform
gyrus recognizes written letters and
words — a finding that is remarkably
consistent across speakers of different
languages. Studies of the VWFA reveal
connections between it and the brain
areas that process visual informa-
tion, bridges that help the brain link

meaning to written language. Like-
wise, there are specific brain areas that
represent numbers and their meaning.
These concepts are represented in the
parietal cortex with input from the
occipitotemporal cortex, a region that
participates in visual recognition and
reading. These regions work together
to identify the shape of a written
number or symbol and connect it to
its concept, which can be broad: For
example, the number “3” is applied
to sets of objects, the concept of trios,
and the rhythm of a waltz.
Thus, through constructing
hierarchical, connected representations
of concepts, the brain is able to build
meaning. All of these skills depend
on the fluid and efficient retrieval and
manipulation of semantic knowledge.

**LANGUAGE PROCESSING**
In mid-19th century France,
a young man named Louis
Victor Leborgne came to live at the
Bicêtre Hospital in the suburbs south
of Paris. Oddly, the only word he
could speak was a single syllable:
“Tan.” In the last few days of his life,
he met a physician named Pierre Paul
Broca. Conversations with the young
man, whom the world of neuroscience
came to know as Patient Tan, led
Broca to understand that Leborgne
could comprehend others’ speech and
was responding as best he could, but
“tan” was the only expression he was
capable of uttering.
After Leborgne died, Broca per-
formed an autopsy and found a large
damaged area, or lesion, in a portion
of the frontal lobe. Since then, we
have learned that damage to particular
regions within the left hemisphere
produces specific kinds of language
disorders, or aphasias. The portion
of the frontal lobe where Leborgne’s


lesion was located is still called Broca’s
area, and it is vital for speech produc-
tion. Further studies of aphasia have
greatly increased our knowledge about
the neural basis of language.
Broca’s aphasia is also called
“non-fluent” aphasia, because speech
production is impaired but compre-
hension is mostly intact. Damage
to the left frontal lobe can produce
non-fluent aphasias, in which speech
output is slow and halting, requires
great effort, and often lacks complex
word or sentence structure. But while
their speaking is impaired, non-fluent
aphasics still comprehend spoken lan-
guage, although their understanding of
complex sentences can be poor.
Shortly after Broca published his
findings, a German physician, Carl
Wernicke, wrote about a 59-year-old
woman he referred to as S.A., who had
lost her ability to understand speech.
Unlike patient Leborgne, S.A.
could speak fluently, but her utteranc-
es made no sense: she offered absurd



answers to questions, used made-up
words, and had difficulty naming fa-
miliar items. After her death, Wernicke
determined that she had damage in her
left temporal lobe. This caused her dif-
ficulty in comprehending speech, but
not producing it, a deficit that is now
known as “Wernicke’s aphasia,” or “flu-
ent aphasia.” Fluent aphasic patients
might understand short individual
words, and their speech can sound nor-
mal in tone and speed, but it is often
riddled with errors in sound and word
selection and tends to be unintelligible.
Another type of aphasia is called
“pure word deafness,” which is caused
by damage to the superior temporal
lobes in both hemispheres. Patients
with this disorder are unable to com-
prehend heard speech on any level.
But they are not deaf. They can hear
speech, music, and other sounds, and
can detect the tone, emotion, and even
the gender of a speaker. But they can-
not link the sound of words to their
meaning. (They can, however, make



Language is a complex cognitive ability, involving several areas of the brain. The blue area in
this image is Broca’s area, which is vital for speech production. The green area is Wernicke’s
area, which is responsible for understanding others’ speech. They and other areas work in
tandem for many types of communication.

perfect sense of written language, be-
cause visual information bypasses the
damaged auditory comprehension area
of the temporal lobe.)
Although Broca and Wernicke’s
work emphasized the role of the left
hemisphere in speech and language
ability, scientists now know that rec-
ognizing speech sounds and individual
words actually involves both the left
and right temporal lobes. Nonetheless,
producing complex speech is strongly
dependent on the left hemisphere,
including the frontal lobe as well as
posterior regions in the temporal lobe.
These areas are critical for accessing
appropriate words and speech sounds.
Reading and writing require
the involvement of additional brain
regions — those controlling vision and
movement. Earlier, we mentioned that
sensory processing of written words
entails connections between the brain’s
language areas and the areas that pro-
cess visual perceptions. In the case of
reading and writing, many of the same
centers involved in speech comprehen-
sion and production are still essential,
but require input from visual areas that
analyze the shapes of letters and words,
as well as output to the motor areas
that control the hand.

**New Insights in
Language Research**
Although our under-
standing of how the
brain processes language is far from
complete, recent molecular genetic
studies of inherited language disorders
have provided important new insights.
One language-associated gene, called
FOXP2, codes for a special type of
protein that switches other genes on
and off in particular parts of the brain.
Rare mutations in FOXP2 result in
difficulty making mouth and jaw


movements in the sequences required
for speech. The disability is also
accompanied by difficulty with spoken
and written language.
Remarkably, many insights
into human speech have come from
studies of birds, where it is possible to
induce genetic mutations and study
their effects on singing. Just as human
babies learn language during a special
developmental period, baby birds
learn their songs by imitating a vocal
model (a parent or other adult bird)
during an early critical period. Like
babies’ speech, birds’ song-learning
also depends on auditory feedback
— their ability to hear their own
attempts at imitation. Interestingly,
studies have also revealed that FOXP2
mutations can disrupt song develop-
ment in young birds, much as they do
in humans.
Imaging studies have revealed that
disruption of FOXP2 can severely
affect signaling in the dorsal striatum,
part of the basal ganglia located deep
in the brain. Specialized neurons in the
dorsal striatum express high levels of
the product of FOXP2. Mutations in
FOXP2 interrupt the flow of informa-
tion through the striatum and result
in speech deficits. These findings show
the gene’s importance in regulating
signaling between motor and speech
regions of the brain. Changes in the
nucleotide sequence of FOXP2 might
have influenced the development
of spoken language in humans and
explain why humans speak and chim-
panzees do not.
Functional imaging studies have
also identified brain structures not
previously known to be involved in
language. For example, portions of
the middle and inferior temporal lobe
participate in accessing the meaning of
words. In addition, the anterior tem-



poral lobe is under intense investiga-
tion as a site that might participate in
sentence-level comprehension. Recent
work has also identified a sensory-mo-
tor circuit for speech in the left poste-
rior temporal lobe, which is thought to
help communication between the sys-
tems for speech recognition and speech
production. This circuit is involved in
speech development and is likely to
support verbal short-term memory.



COGNITION AND
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION
Executive Function
Some of the most complex
processes in the brain occur in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the outer,
folded layers of the brain located just
behind your forehead. The PFC is one
of the last regions of the brain to
develop, not reaching full maturity
until adulthood. This is one reason
why children’s brains function quite
differently from those of adults. The
processing that takes place in this area
is known as executive function. Like
the chief executive officer (CEO) of a
company, the PFC supervises every-
thing else the brain does, taking in
sensory and emotional information
and using this information to plan and
execute decisions and actions.
Specific areas of the PFC support
executive functions such as selecting,
rehearsing, and monitoring informa-
tion being retrieved from long-term
memory. To serve these functions, the
PFC also interacts with a large net-
work of posterior cortical areas that
encode specific types of information
— for example, visual images, sounds,
words, and the spatial location in
which events occurred.
Although more fully evolved in
humans, some aspects of executive
function are displayed by other

animals. Studies in nonhuman pri-
mates have shown that neurons in the
PFC keep information active or “in
mind” while the animal is carrying
out a task that depends on it. This
is analogous to working memory
in humans, which is a form of
executive function.
Executive function can be con-
sidered a blend of three core skills:
inhibition, working memory, and
shifting. Inhibition is the ability to
suppress a behavior or action when it
is inappropriate — such as calling out
loudly when one is in an audience or
classroom. Even toddlers demonstrate
hints of a developing inhibition ability,
as shown in their ability to delay (for
at least a short period of time) eating
a treat placed in front of them. By the
time children reach preschool, they
can tackle more complex inhibition
tasks, such as “Lucia’s hand game,”
in which they are told to make a fist
when shown a finger and a finger
when shown a fist. This test, which
requires inhibiting their more


automatic imitation of adults, is very
hard for three-year-olds, but four-
year-olds perform significantly better.
As people grow older, they wield this
ability ever more skillfully.
In addition to inhibition, this
hand game and similar tasks rely on
working memory, which is the ability
to hold a rule in mind while you decide
how to act (in this case, opposite the
demonstrator). When you have new
experiences, information initially enters
your working memory, a transient form
of declarative or conscious memory.
Working memory depends on both the
PFC and the parietal lobe. It gives you
the ability to maintain and manipulate
information over a brief period of time
without external aids or cues — such as
remembering a phone number with-
out writing it down. Most people can
memorize and recite a string of num-
bers or words over a brief period of
time, but if they are distracted or there
is a time lag of many minutes or hours,
they are likely to forget. This shows the
duration of working memory, which



requires active rehearsal and conscious
focus to maintain.
The third key component of ex-
ecutive function is shifting, or mental
flexibility, which allows you to adjust
your ongoing behavior when condi-
tions require it. For example, in the
card sorting task, people must figure
out (from the examiner’s simple “yes/
no” responses) that they must switch
from sorting by one rule, such as suit,
and begin sorting by another, such
as number. People with damage to
their PFC have great difficulty doing
this and tend to stick with the first
sorting rule. Children’s ability to shift
successfully between tasks follows a
developmental course through adoles-
cence. It appears that preschool-aged
children can handle shifts between
simple task sets in a card-sorting task
and later handle unexpected shifts be-
tween increasingly complex task sets.
Both behavioral and physiological
measures indicate that the ability to
monitor one’s errors is evident during
adolescence; by mid-adolescence,
more complex task switching reaches
adult-like levels. Because of its greater
need for multiple cognitive process-
es, mature shifting likely involves a
network of activity in many regions
of the PFC.
Many of the changes in execu-
tive functioning ability are gradual,
although the changes are more appar-
ent in young children. The PFC is the
main region implicated in executive
functioning; however, the skills that
fall under this umbrella use inputs
from all over the brain. Interestingly,
the activity level associated with
executive function actually decreases
as children and adolescents mature,
reflecting the fact that these circuits
become more fine-tuned and efficient
as the neuron networks mature.


Scientists can observe the brain activity underlying advanced cognitive functions, such as
creativity. In this image, researchers were able to measure activity in the brains of jazz musi-
cians while they improvised. This gave them a clue as to what brain regions are associated
with creative thinking.

**Decision-Making**
The fundamental skills of exec-
utive function — inhibition,
working memory, and shifting — pro-
vide the basis for other skills. One of
these is decision-making, which
requires a person to weigh values,
understand rules, plan for the future,
and make predictions about the
outcomes of choices.
You make many different types
of decisions every day. Some of these
rely primarily on logical reasoning —
for example, when you compare the
timetables for the bus and subway
to determine the quickest way to get
to a friend’s house. Other decisions
have emotional consequences at stake,
like when the person you’re trying to
impress offers you a cigarette — your
desire to be accepted might outweigh
your rational consideration of smok-
ing’s harms. This is an example of
affective decision-making (Chapter 4).
Both types of decision-making
involve the brain’s prefrontal cortex
(PFC). In particular, activity in the
lateral PFC is especially important
in overriding emotional responses in
decision-making. The area’s strong
connections with brain regions related
to motivation and emotion, such as
the amygdala and nucleus accumbens,
seem to exert a sort of top-down
control over emotional and impulsive
responses. For example, brain imaging
studies have found the lateral PFC is
more active in people declining a small
monetary reward given immediately
in favor of receiving a larger reward in
the future. This is one of the last areas
of the brain to mature — usually in
a person’s late 20s — which explains
why teens have trouble regulating
emotions and controlling impulses.


The orbitofrontal cortex, a region
of the PFC located just behind the
eyes, appears to be important in
affective decision-making, especially in
situations involving reward and pun-
ishment. The area has been implicated
in addiction as well as social behavior.



Social Neuroscience
Humans, like many other
animals, are highly social
creatures. Accordingly, large parts of
our brain are dedicated to processing
information about other people. Social
neuroscience refers to the study of
neural functions that underlie inter-
personal behavior, such as reading
social cues, understanding social rules,
choosing socially-appropriate respons-
es, and understanding oneself and
others. The latter process is known as
“mentalizing” — making sense of your
own thought processes and those of
others. The medial PFC, as well as
some areas of the lateral PFC, are
highly involved in these skills.
Mentalizing underlies some of our
most complex and fascinating mental
abilities. These include empathy and
“theory of mind,” which is under-
standing the mental states of others
and the reasons for their actions.
Until recently, research devoted little
emphasis to the social and emotional
abilities needed for these higher-order
mental functions, but now such topics
are being avidly studied.
An obvious way that we under-
stand the mental states of others is by
observing their actions. This requires
the brain to see and recognize others’
movements and facial expressions, and
then draw inferences about the feelings
and intentions that drive them. Scien-
tists have learned how brain activity



drives these processes by scanning
people’s brains with fMRI as subjects
watch video clips of other people.
Several regions in the medial
prefrontal cortex help us make judg-
ments about ourselves and others.
In addition, a specific region at the
border of temporal and parietal lobes,
the temporoparietal junction (TPJ),
appears to focus on others and not on
the self. The TPJ is also activated when
we watch others engage in actions that
seem at odds with their intentions or
in actions intended to be deceptive.
A popular, though controversial,
theory of social cognition centered
on the discovery of “mirror neurons.”
In the 1990’s, scientists identified
neurons in the motor cortex of rhesus
macaques that fired when the mon-
keys performed a specific action. They
were astonished to find these neurons
also fired when the monkeys simply
watched another person or monkey
perform that same action. The findings
prompted speculation that mirror neu-
rons underlie our ability to understand
another person’s actions. Additional
studies revealed humans also possessed
mirror neurons, and in even wider
brain networks.
Mirror neurons permeated pop-
ular media. Within a decade of their
discovery, however, mirror neurons’
role in social cognition was called into
question — many scientists argued
that there was little direct evidence
supporting mirror neurons’ purported
roles in theory of mind, mentalizing,
and empathy.
Researchers are continuing to in-
vestigate mirror neurons, as well as the
complexities of the human brain that
allow us understand and empathize
with others.

eurons develop through
delicate and carefully cho-
reographed processes that
take place while an embryo grows.
Signaling molecules “turn on” certain
genes and “turn off ” others, initiating
the formation of immature nerve cells.
During the next stage — cell division,
also called proliferation — the pool of
early-stage brain cells increases by bil-
lions. Finally, during migration, these
newly formed neurons travel to their
final destinations. The nervous system
formed by these processes is active
throughout life, making new connec-
tions and fine-tuning the way messages
are sent and received. In this chapter,
you will learn about the amazing early
development of your ever-changing
nervous system.



THE JOURNEY
OF NERVE CELLS
Formation and Induction
During the very early stages of
embryonic development, three layers
emerge — the ectoderm (outer-most
layer), mesoderm (middle layer),
and endoderm (inner-most layer).
Although the cells in each layer con-
tain identical DNA instructions for
development, these layers ultimately
give rise to the rich variety of tissue
types that make up the human body.
The explanation for this diversity lies
in signals produced by surrounding
tissues. Those signals turn certain
genes on and others off, thus inducing
the development of specific cell types.
Signals from the mesoderm trigger
some ectoderm cells to become nerve
tissue, a process called neural induc-
tion. Subsequent signaling interactions
refine the nerve tissue into the basic
categories of neurons or glia (support
cells), and then into subclasses of each
cell type.

**The Developing Brain 6**

The fate of a developing cell is
largely determined by its proximity
to various sources of signaling mol-
ecules. The concentration of each
type of signaling molecule decreases
farther from its source, creating
gradients throughout the brain.
For example, a particular signaling
molecule, called sonic hedgehog,
is secreted from mesodermal tissue
lying beneath the developing spi-
nal cord. As a result of exposure to
this signal, adjacent nerve cells are
converted into a specialized class
of glia. Cells that are farther away
are exposed to lower concentrations
of sonic hedgehog, so they become
motor neurons that control the
movement of muscles. An even lower
concentration promotes the forma-
tion of interneurons, which don’t
relay messages to muscles but to oth-
er neurons. Interestingly, the mech-
anism of this molecular signaling is
very similar in species as diverse as
flies and humans.


Proliferation
In the brain, neurons arise
from a fairly small pool of neu-
ral stem and progenitor cells, special
cells that can divide and become a
variety of mature cell types. Before
achieving their mature cell fate, this
pool of cells undergoes a series of
divisions — increasing the number of
cells that will ultimately form the
brain. Early divisions are symmetric
— the split results in two identical
daughter cells, both able to keep
dividing. But as these divisions
progress, the cells begin to divide
asymmetrically, giving rise to only one
daughter cell that keeps proliferating
and a second that progresses towards
its ultimate cell fate as a neural or glial
cell (the exact sequences and ultimate
fates vary by species).
This proliferative process permits
rapid growth during early development
of the brain, with billions of cells being
produced in a matter of weeks. After
that series of divisions is complete,



only a few neural stem and progenitor
cells remain within the brain, and neu-
rogenesis in adulthood is limited to a
few regions of the brain, such as those
involved with memory.
Scientists have proposed that
protein defects causing a premature
switch from symmetric to asymmetric
divisions may be a cause of micro-
cephaly. This disorder, characterized
by a severe reduction in brain size, is
associated with serious neurological
disabilities and sometimes death in
infancy. Similarly, excessive prolifera-
tion of brain cells can lead to a disor-
der called megalencephaly — a brain
that is abnormally large and heavy —
which is also associated with a variety
of neurodevelopmental complications.



Migration
After neural induction and pro-
liferation occur, new neurons journey
from the inner surface of the embry-
onic brain, where they formed, to their
long-term locations in the brain. This


After three week’s gestation, the human brain begins to form. The first stage is the neural tube, pictured at left. By four weeks, the individual
sections of the brain can be recognized. In 6 months, the ridges of the brain can be observed.

process is called migration, and it be-
gins three to four weeks after a human
baby is conceived. At this time, the
ectoderm starts to thicken and build
up along the midline of the embryo.
As the cells continue to divide, a flat
neural plate grows, followed by the
formation of parallel ridges, some-
what resembling the creases in a paper
airplane, that rise along either side of
the midline. These ridges extend from
the “head end”, where the future brain
will form, along the length of the em-
bryo where the future spinal cord will
develop. Within a few days, the ridges
fold toward each other and fuse into
a hollow neural tube. The head end
of the tube thickens into three bulges
that form the hindbrain, the midbrain,
and the forebrain. Later in the process,
at week 7 in humans, the first signs of
the eyes and the brain’s hemispheres
appear. As new neurons are produced,
they move from the neural tube’s ven-


tricular zone, which lies along the inner
surface of the tube, toward the border
of the marginal zone, or outer surface.
After neurons stop dividing, they form
an intermediate zone where they grad-
ually accumulate as the brain develops.
A variety of guidance cue neurons to
migrate to their final destinations.
The most common guidance
mechanism, accounting for about
90 percent of migration in humans,
is the radial glia, which project
radially from the intermediate zone
to the cortex. Neurons use these glia
as scaffolding, inching along glial
projections until they reach their final
destinations. This process of radial
migration occurs in an “inside-out”
manner; that is, the cells that arrive
the earliest (the oldest ones) form the
deepest layer of the cortex, whereas
the late-arriving (youngest) neurons
form the outermost layer. Through a
different mechanism, other neurons



migrate sideways, or tangentially
(rather than radially), moving parallel
to the brain’s surface and across the
radial cortical columns.
Migration is a finely tuned process
that can be influenced by many fac-
tors. For example, exposure to alcohol,
cocaine, or radiation, can prevent
proper migration, resulting in mis-
placement of cells, which can lead to
intellectual disability or epilepsy. Fur-
thermore, mutations in the genes that
regulate migration have been shown to
cause rare genetic forms of intellectual
disability and epilepsy in humans.



Making Connections
After neurons reach
their final locations,
they begin making the connections
that will determine how particular
functions such as vision or hearing can
occur. Induction, proliferation, and
migration occur internally during fetal
development, but the next phases of
brain development depend increasing-
ly on external experience. After birth,
factors such as watching a mobile spin,
listening to a voice, and even proper
nutrition influence the connections
formed by neurons.
Neurons become interconnected
through their short branches called
dendrites and long axons — two
types of processes that extend from
a neuron’s cell body (soma). Axons
produce and transmit signals to other
neurons, and dendrites receive signals
from the axons that contact them.
To reach their targets, axons can span
distances many times the size of their
cell body, many crossing to the op-
posite side of the brain. The longest
human axons are in the periphery,
extending from the lower spinal cord
all the way to muscles in the toes.
Given the distance from spinal cord


New neurons, shown here in the mouse, are born throughout life in a specific region of the
brain’s hippocampus. This region, known as the dentate gyrus, is involved in pattern
separation, the ability to discriminate between very similar memories.

**The Developing Brain 6**

to toes of a basketball player — a
meter or more — such axons might
be nearly a million times longer than
their diameter!
A developing axon grows by
the extension of its growth cone, an
enlargement at the tip of the axon
that actively explores the environment
to seek out its precise destination. A
growth cone is guided to that final
destination by molecular cues in its
environment. Some of these molecules
stud the surfaces of cells, while others
are secreted into areas near the growth
cone. Receptors on the growth cone
enable its responses to these environ-
mental cues. Binding of environmen-
tal molecules tells the growth cone
whether to move forward, stop, recoil,
or change direction. Attractive cues lay
a path growth cones follow, while re-
pellent molecules funnel growth cones
through precise corridors. Signaling
molecules include families of proteins
with names such as netrin, sema-
phorin, and ephrin.
One truly remarkable finding is
that most of these proteins are com-
mon to many organisms — worms,
insects, and mammals including
humans. Each family of proteins is
smaller in flies or worms than in mice
or people, but its functions are very
similar. As a result, simpler animals
are highly useful experimental models
for gaining knowledge that direct-
ly applies to humans. For example,
netrin was first discovered in a worm,
where it was found to guide neurons
around the worm’s “nerve ring.” Later,
vertebrate netrins were found to guide
axons around the mammalian spinal
cord. When receptors for netrins were
then discovered in worms, this knowl-
edge proved invaluable in finding the
corresponding, and related, receptors
in humans.


Synapse Formation
Once axons reach their targets,
a specialized connection called
a synapse begins to form. At the
synapse, only a tiny space separates
the signaling portion of the axon
from the receiving portion of the
dendrite. Electrical signals that travel
down the axon trigger the release of
chemical messages called neurotrans-
mitters, which diffuse across this



space and are received by receptors on
the target dendrite. Such chemical
cues can either promote or hinder the
generation of a new electrical signal
in the receiving neuron. The com-
bined effects of such cues from
thousands of synapses ultimately
determine how a receiving neuron
responds. A human brain contains
trillions of these synapses, which gives
rise to the brain’s astounding capacity
for information processing.
For this processing to occur
properly, the formation of synaptic
connections must be highly specific.
Some specificity is the result of the
mechanisms that guide each axon to
its proper target. Additional mole-
cules mediate target recognition when
the axon reaches the proper location.



Dendrites are also actively involved in
initiating contact with axons, and both
sides produce proteins that span the
space between them and anchor the
synapse together.
Once initial contact is established,
a synapse continues to differentiate.
On the presynaptic side, the tiny axon
terminal that contacts the dendrite
becomes specialized for releasing neu-
rotransmitters, stocking itself with neu-



rotransmitter packets, and proteins that
enable those packets to be held in place
and then released. On the dendritic
— or postsynaptic — side, receptors
that respond to those neurotransmit-
ters begin to dot the membrane. Both
processes ensure that a synapse can
transmit signals quickly and effectively.
New evidence has implicated a
third important player in the proper
formation of a synapse. Astrocytes
are a type of glial cell in the brain
previously thought to simply pro-
vide scaffolding and passive support
to neurons. They are now known to
exert their own influence on synaptic
development and function. Many
synapses in the brain are contacted
by astrocytes, and studies in rodents
have found that a single astrocyte can


A human brain contains trillions of

these synapses, which gives rise

to the brain’s astounding capacity

for information processing.

### 48 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**6 The Developing Brain**

contact thousands of synapses across
multiple neurons. The importance of
astrocytes in synapse formation is also
shown in other studies. Some neu-
rons form only a few synapses when
developing in a culture dish from
which astrocytes are absent, and recent
research has discovered that molecules
secreted by astrocytes regulate aspects
of synaptic development.
Scientists are learning that mol-
ecules from multiple sources work
together to promote proper synapse
formation. It is now thought that
defects in such molecules could con-
tribute to disorders such as autism. In
addition, the loss of certain other mol-
ecules might underlie the degradation
of synapses that occurs during aging.
An array of signals determines
which type of neurotransmitter a neu-
ron will use to communicate. For some
cells, such as motor neurons, the type
of neurotransmitter is fixed (acetylcho-
line), but for other neurons, it is not.
Scientists have found that when cer-
tain immature neurons are maintained
in a culture dish with no other cell
types, they produce the neurotransmit-
ter norepinephrine. In contrast, when
the same neurons are cultured with
specific cells, such as cardiac tissue,
they produce the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. Just as genetic and
environmental signals can modulate
the development of specialized cells,
a similar process leads to production
of specific neurotransmitters. Many
researchers believe that the signal to
engage the gene, and therefore the
final determination of the chemical
messenger a neuron will produce, is


influenced by factors that come from
the location of the synapse itself.



Myelination
Insulation that covers wires
preserves the strength of electrical
signals that travel through them. The
myelin sheath that covers axons serves
a similar function. Myelination, the
fatty wrapping of axons by extensions
of glia, increases — by as much as 100
times — the speed at which signals can
travel along axons. This increase is a
function of how the sheath is wrapped,
with somewhat regularly spaced gaps
called nodes of Ranvier interrupting
the sheath. The alternating pattern of
insulation and nodes allows electrical
signals to move down an axon faster,
jumping from one node to the next.
This phenomenon, called saltatory con-
duction (“saltatory” means “leaping”), is
responsible for more rapid transmission
of electrical signals. Formation of my-
elin occurs throughout the lifespan.



Paring Back
After its initial growth, the
neural network is pared back,
creating a more efficient system. In
fact, only about half the neurons
generated during development survive
to function in an adult. Entire popula-
tions of neurons are removed through
apoptosis, a process of programmed
cell death initiated in the cells. Apop-
tosis is activated if a neuron fails to
receive enough life-sustaining chemical
signals called trophic factors, which are
produced in limited quantities by
target tissues. Each type of trophic
factor supports the survival of a



distinct group of neurons. For exam-
ple, nerve growth factor is important
for the survival of sensory neurons. It
has recently become clear that apopto-
sis is maintained into adulthood but
constantly held in check. Based on
this, researchers have found that
injuries and some neurodegenerative
diseases kill neurons not by directly
inflicting damage but by activating the
cells’ own death programs. This
discovery — and its implication that
death need not follow insult — have
led to new avenues for therapy.
Just as too many brain cells
develop early on, these cells initially
form an excessive number of connec-
tions. In primates, for example, neural
projections from the two eyes to the
brain initially overlap; then, in some
portions of the brain, they sort into
separate territories devoted to one eye
or the other. Furthermore, connections
between neurons in a young primate’s
cerebral cortex are more numerous and
twice as concentrated as in an adult
primate. The pruning of these excess
connections is heavily dependent on
the relative activity of each connec-
tion. Connections that are active and
generating electrical currents survive,
while those with relatively little activity
are lost. Astrocytes and other glia also
play an important role in this process.
For example, astrocytes are known to
aid the formation of eye-specific con-
nections by engulfing and eliminating
unnecessary synapses. Thus, at least to
some extent, the circuits of the adult
brain are formed by pruning away
incorrect connections to leave only
the correct ones.

by which brain cells form, become
specialized, travel to their appropri-
ate locations, and connect with each
other in increasingly elaborate adaptive
networks is the central challenge of
developmental neurobiology.
Advances in the study of brain
development have become increasingly
relevant for medical treatments. For
example, several diseases that scientists
once thought were purely adult disor-
ders are now being considered from
a developmental perspective. Schizo-
phrenia might actually occur because
pathways in the brain and connections
to it formed incorrectly in early life.
Other research suggests that genes that
influence brain development could
also play a role in a person’s suscepti-

And regeneration following brain inju-
ry is now considered a realistic possi-
bility, thanks to expanding knowledge
of how neurons form connections
during early development.
Knowing how the brain was first
constructed is an essential step toward
understanding its later ability to reor-
ganize in response to external influ-
ences or injuries. As the brain develops
from the embryo to the adult, unique
attributes evolve during infancy and
childhood that will influence people’s
differences in learning ability as well as
their vulnerability to specific brain dis-
orders. Neuroscientists are starting to
discover general principles that underlie
these intricate developmental processes.

development in the womb? After birth,
the baby’s brain continues to grow and
develop. The average brain-weight of
a newborn human baby is about 370
grams (or 13 ounces), just slightly less
than a pound. Compare that to the
average weight of an adult brain:
3 pounds, with about 86 billion neu-
rons. The newborn baby’s brain is the
product of 40 weeks of brain devel-
opment, and its rapid development
continues after birth.
How fast does an infant’s brain
grow? Immediately after birth, the
growth rate of the whole brain is about
1 percent per day. The rate slows as the
baby ages, reaching about 0.4 percent
per day by 3 months after birth. By the
time a baby is 90 days old, its overall
brain volume is 64 percent larger than
it was at birth, with the fastest-growing
brain region, the cerebellum, more
than double its volume at birth. Not
only is the cerebellum the brain region
with the most neurons, but it helps
with learning motor skills and move-
ments — highly important for babies
learning to grab things and eat food.
The overall increase in brain volume
is the result of a large number of brain
cells growing, multiplying (proliferat-
ing), maturing (differentiating), and
migrating to different brain regions.
During the first three months of life,
the number of neurons in the cortex
increases by 23–30 percent. The den-
drites and axons of these neurons grow
longer and make many connections, or
synapses (synaptogenesis), which also
makes the brain bigger. Adding even

percent the size of an adult brain. That’s
far too many synapses for the brain to
maintain, as synapses use energy and
resources. Therefore, during early child-
hood, the brain begins to reduce the
number of synapses and fine-tune the
connections — this synaptic pruning
process is shaped by toddlers’ experi-
ences as they grow. Just as pruning rose
bushes gets rid of the dying or weaker
branches so that nutrients go to the
newer branches and enable new roses to
bloom and flourish, synaptic pruning
allows weaker connections to diminish
while stronger synapses that are activat-
ed more often will grow and stabilize.

**EXPERIENCE SHAPES
THE BRAIN**
Are the brains of human
babies similar to the brains of
other baby animals such as kittens and
ducklings? Compared to other ani-
mals, humans are actually born with
less developed brains, and human
brains take longer to mature. Squirrel
monkeys, for example, reach their
adult brain size at 6 months old.
Rather than developing more fully in
the womb or egg, human brains grow
and develop extensively after birth.
One advantage is that our developing
brains are more easily shaped by
environment and experience, which
helps us adapt appropriately to the
surrounding environment.
A baby’s early life experiences —


seeing parents’ faces, hearing their
voices, and being held in its parents’
arms — provide important sensory
inputs that shape connections be-
tween neurons. During these critical
periods of development, inputs from
sensory, motor, and even emotional
aspects of life experiences affect how
the brain develops and adapts to the
given environment. Both genes and
environment exert strong influenc-
es during critical periods, forming
neural circuits that affect learning and
behavior. Part of shaping these con-
nections involves neuronal cell death
and synaptic pruning, which occur
in the embryo and in early postnatal
life. Interestingly, changes in neural
connections during critical periods
coincide with high rates of learning,
such as a toddler learning to run or to
speak multiple languages.



INTO ADOLESCENCE
What’s going on in the typical
teenage brain? It’s no surprise
that many changes are happening
during adolescence, in the body as
well as the brain. But what’s amazing
is the brain’s capacity to learn during
these teenage years. The teen brain is
like a big ball of clay, ready to change
and be molded by new experiences
— but it is also very messy. During
this time, more synaptic pruning
occurs, with stronger connections
beating out weaker ones in a process
called competitive elimination. At the
same time, the brain is improving its
connections, with neurons extending
their dendritic branches and myelin-
ation of axons increasing, especially in
the frontal lobes.
In exploring how the brain chang-
es during the aging process, scientists
are particularly interested in longi-
tudinal studies, which track human



subjects over extended periods of time.
Longitudinal studies are especially
important because they can reveal how
early life events and environment can
affect outcomes later in life, like edu-
cation or risk for disease. These studies
are also helpful for understanding how
a healthy brain changes between early
childhood and adolescence. Adoles-
cence can be thought of as a second
“critical period” as the more complex
functions of the brain develop and can
be influenced by environment
and experience.
Images of the adolescent brain ob-
tained by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) show an increase in white matter
volume, especially in the corpus callo-
sum — a large bundle of myelinated
fibers that connects the brain’s right
and left cerebral hemispheres. The
growth of the corpus callosum may
explain enhanced learning capacity
in adolescence, due to the increasing
connections. Enhanced connections,
changes in the brain’s reward systems,
and changes in the balance between
frontal and limbic brain regions can all
contribute to teenage behaviors such
as increased risk taking and sensation
seeking — also aspects of an enhanced
learning ability.
Unfortunately, this can be a
double-edged sword, as the associated
risk taking and sensation seeking also
increase the risk of addiction. Some
regard addiction as a type of acquired
learning disorder, pointing to the over-
lap between brain regions involved in
addiction and those supporting learn-
ing, memory, and reasoning. Frequent
drug use during adolescence is asso-
ciated with damage to brain regions
important for cognitive functions such
as memory, attention, and executive
functioning. Studies using MRI to
measure brain volume and a technique

called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
to study quality of white matter show
that alcohol and other drugs of abuse
may cause significant changes in gray
and white matter in adolescents. Com-
pared to a healthy adolescent brain,
adolescents who used alcohol had re-
duced gray matter volume and reduced
white matter integrity. Another study
used fMRI to measure brain activity
and showed that binge drinking (alco-
hol) during adolescence was associated
with lower brain activity, less sustained
attention, and poorer performance on
a working memory task.
When do we become adults? The
definition of adulthood varies with the
context — social, judicial, educational.
Neuroscience research indicates that
human brains continue to develop un-
til we are about 30 years old. Different
brain regions show different rates of
growth and maturation. For example,
MRI studies show that the gray matter
density of most brain regions declines
with age; however, gray matter densi-
ty increases in the left temporal lobe
(important for memory and language)
until age 30. Brain development in
20-somethings also includes changes
in where myelination occurs. Remem-
ber that myelination is important for
efficiently conducting electrical signals
along axons, and myelin protects axons
from damage. Earlier in life, more
myelination is found in the visual,
auditory, and limbic cortices. Closer to
30, the frontal and parietal neocortices
become more myelinated, which helps
with working memory and higher
cognitive functions.
These frontal lobe regions are the
last brain regions to develop, gaining
more myelin later in life. The frontal


lobe is important for executive func-
tioning, which includes attention,
response inhibition, emotion, organi-
zation, and long-range planning. The
late maturation of the frontal lobe
might explain characteristics of a “typ-
ical teenager,” such as a short attention
span, blurting out whatever comes to
mind, and forgetting to do homework.
However, none of this means that the
teenage brain is broken. It is simply
experiencing a critical period of devel-
opment that also opens the brain to
millions of new learning opportunities.



PLASTICITY
Plasticity is the ability of the
brain to modify itself and
adapt to environmental challenges,
including sensory inputs. Without
plasticity, critical periods would not
exist because the brain could not
respond to environment and experi-
ence. Plasticity is not unique to
humans, but our brains’ capacity to
adapt is a defining attribute of
human beings. Plasticity has been
categorized as experience-expectant
or experience-dependent.
Experience-expectant plasticity
refers to integrating environmental
stimuli into normal developmental
patterns. Being exposed to certain
common or universal environmental
experiences — for example, hearing
language, seeing faces, or being held
— during limited critical, or sensitive,
periods of development is essential for
healthy brain maturation. An example
comes from the bird world; finches
that do not hear adult songs before
sexual maturation will not learn to
sing as well as other members of their
species. In this case, the environmental



stimuli are the sounds of adult songs,
which shape the normal development
of the bird’s ability to sing accurately.
Experience-dependent plasticity
describes continuing changes in the
organization and specialization of a
person’s brain regions as a result of
life experiences that are not universal
or anticipated. These include skills
that develop throughout life, with no
critical or optimal period for their ac-
quisition. For example, not everyone
will play the violin, but violinists of-
ten show greater cortical development
in the brain region associated with the
fingers of their left hand. Using an ex-
citing technology called two-photon
imaging, scientists can observe living
neurons in animals with a microscope
and track their growth after various
experiences. The results of these
studies indicate that experience-de-
pendent plasticity occurs not only
during critical periods but also during
adulthood — apparently, our brains
are always changing in response to
our experiences.
Recent insights into brain devel-
opment hold considerable promise
for new treatments of neurological
disorders, traumatic brain injury, and
learning disabilities, and could help us
understand aging as well. If scientists
can design an approach to manipulat-
ing adult plasticity — whether with
drugs or with therapies that involve
rewiring neural circuits — it might be
possible to correct problems that result
from mistimed critical periods or sim-
ilar dysfunctions. A better understand-
ing of normal brain function during
each developmental stage could be the
key to finding age-specific therapies for
many brain disorders.

he previous chapter described
how your brain changes as
you grow — in overall size,
number of cells, myelination, and
synapse formation — even continuing
to develop well beyond your teenage
years. In fact, recent research suggests
that maturation is still occurring in the
third decade of your life. So when does
a human brain finally reach maturity?
What is the structure of a fully-formed
adult brain? And what can it do that a
developing brain cannot?



THE ADULT BRAIN
An adult brain differs from an
adolescent brain in many ways.
Between childhood and adulthood, a
human brain loses gray matter as
excess neurons and synapses are
pruned away, although the rate of loss
slows down by a person’s late 20s. At
the same time, some brain regions
strengthen their connections with each
other, and the major nerve tracts
become wrapped in insulating myelin,
which increases the brain’s white
matter. Around age 40, the white
matter in the human brain has reached
its peak volume.
Much of the added white mat-
ter represents increased connections
between widely separated brain areas.
During childhood and adolescence,
most brain networks are locally
organized, with areas near each other
working together to accomplish a cog-
nitive task. In adulthood, the brain’s
organization is more widely distribut-
ed, with distant areas connected and
working together.
The most important brain area to
become fully “wired up” in adulthood
is the prefrontal cortex (PFC) — the
front (anterior) portion of the frontal
lobe. This area handles many of our
higher-level cognitive abilities such

as planning, solving problems, and
making decisions. It is also important
for cognitive control — the ability to
suppress impulses in favor of more
appropriate responses. Adult brains
are better “wired up” for cognitive
control than are adolescent brains, in
which decision-making is more highly
influenced by emotions, rewards, and
social influences.
Intelligence also peaks during early
to middle adulthood, roughly ages 25
to 60. However, different cognitive
abilities have distinctive patterns of
maturation. Fluid intelligence, which
includes abilities like solving problems
and identifying patterns, peaks around
age 30. By contrast, crystallized intel-


ligence, which deals with vocabulary
and knowledge of facts, increases until
about age 50. Some scientists speculate
that there is no single age at which
all (or even most) of our cognitive
functions are at their peak.



WHAT IS AGING?
Normal vs. Pathological Aging
Aging is a dynamic, gradual pro-
cess. While it can be characterized by
resilience in both physical and neuro-
logical health, too often aging increas-
es the risk of injury and disease. One
such risk is dementia, a decline in
cognitive ability that interferes with
a person’s day-to-day functioning.
While aging is inevitable, dementia



and disability are not. In fact, neu-
roscientists believe our brains can
remain relatively healthy as we age.
Pronounced decline in memory and
cognitive ability, once thought to be
part of normal aging, are now recog-
nized as separate disease processes in
the aging brain. Although the brain
loses some neurons as we age, a wide-
spread and profound loss of neurons
is not part of normal aging.
Nonetheless, some mental decline
is normal. The continuous process
of aging involves subtle changes in
brain structure, chemistry, and func-
tion that commonly begin in midlife.
Some studies suggest that cognition
starts declining as early as the 20s and


As the brain matures, a fatty substance called myelin wraps around axons to speed up electrical transmission. This image shows axons

30s, while other studies indicate that
cognition improves into the 50s or
60s, before declining. A growing area
of neuroscientific research focuses on
understanding “healthy aging,” which
includes lifestyle choices, such as diet
and exercise, which support cognitive
health throughout life.

**HOW THE BRAIN CHANGES
Cognitive Changes**
Subtle changes in cognition are a
normal part of the aging process, with
memory decline being the most com-
mon. However, not all types of mem-
ory are affected; declarative memory
declines with age, but nondeclarative
memory remains largely intact.
As you learned in Chapter 4,
declarative memory includes autobi-
ographical memory of life events, called
episodic memory, and memory of
learned knowledge, or semantic mem-
ory. Nondeclarative memory includes
procedural memory like remembering
how to ride a bike or tie a shoe.
Working memory — the abili-
ty to hold a piece of information in
mind and manipulate it (for exam-
ple, looking up a phone number and
reciting it as you dial) — also declines
with age. Some studies suggest that a
slow decline starts as early as age 30.
Working memory, an example of the
fluid intelligence mentioned above, is
a set of cognitive skills that depend on
rapid processing of new information
rather than on stored knowledge. Oth-
er aspects of fluid intelligence, such as
processing speed and problem-solving,
also decrease with age.
Certain aspects of attention can
also become more difficult as our brains
age. For example, it might be harder to
focus on what friends are saying when
we’re in a noisy restaurant. The ability
to focus on a particular stimulus and


filter out distractions is called selective
attention. Another type of attention,
divided attention, refers to the ability
to focus on two tasks at the same time.
Activities that require this type of split
focus — such as holding a conversation
while driving — also become more
challenging with age.



Structural Changes
All of these alterations in cognitive
ability reflect changes in the brain’s
structure and chemistry. As we enter
midlife, our brains change in subtle but
measurable ways. Studies using brain
imaging techniques have revealed that
total brain volume begins to decline
when people are in their 30s or 40s,
and starts declining at a greater rate
around age 60. However, studies of in-
dividual brain regions suggest that the
volume loss is not uniform throughout
the brain. Some areas appear to shrink
more, and faster, than other areas.
The prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and
hippocampus show the biggest losses,
which worsen in advanced age.
Several changes at the level of
individual neurons can also contribute
to the decreased volume seen in aging
brains. The changes in aging are due
to shrinking neurons, retraction and
decreased complexity of dendrites, and
loss of myelin. In contrast, the volume
loss in adolescence is primarily driven
by synaptic pruning and the death of
excess cells.
Our cerebral cortex, the wrinkled
outer layer of the brain containing
neuron cell bodies, also thins as we
age. Cortical thinning follows a pat-
tern similar to volume loss, with some
regions of the brain affected more than
others. Thinning is especially pro-
nounced in the frontal lobes and parts
of the temporal lobes.
The temporal and frontal lobes



are among the areas that demonstrate
the most pronounced declines in both
volume and cortical thickness. These
are the areas that took longest to reach
maturity. This finding has led to a “last
in, first out” theory of brain aging,
which holds that the last parts of the
brain to develop are the first to deteri-
orate. Interestingly, studies of age-re-
lated changes in white matter support
this hypothesis. The first of the brain’s
long-distance fibers to develop are
the projection fibers that connect the
cortex to lower parts of the brain and
spinal cord. Fibers connecting diffuse
areas within a single hemisphere —
association fibers — are the last to
reach maturity, and show the steepest
functional declines with age.



Neuronal Changes
The aging brain also under-
goes numerous changes at
synapses. Although the synaptic
changes are selective and subtle, their
effect on cognitive decline is believed
to be greater than the effects of
structural and chemical changes. In
the prefrontal cortex and hippocam-
pus, scientists have observed alter-
ations in dendrites, the branching
processes that receive signals from
other neurons. With increasing age,
the dendrites shrink, their branches
become less complex, and they lose
dendritic spines, the tiny protuberanc-
es that receive chemical signals.
A study in rhesus monkeys ob-
served that the aging process targets
a certain class of spines called thin
spines. These small, slender pro-
tuberances are also highly plastic
structures, extending and retracting
much more rapidly than the larger
“mushroom” class of spines. This has
led scientists to speculate that thin
spines might be involved in working


### 56 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

memory, which requires a high degree
of synaptic plasticity. The loss of thin
dendritic spines could impair neuro-
nal communication and contribute
to cognitive decline. So far, direct
evidence of their role in cognitive
decline is lacking, and more studies
are needed.
Finally, the formation of new
neurons also declines with age.
Although neurogenesis was once
believed to halt after birth, we now
know of two brain regions that con-
tinue to add new neurons through-

out life: the olfactory bulbs and the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
Studies suggest that the rate of neu-
rogenesis plummets with age in mice,
but recent human studies suggest a
more modest decline. It is not yet
clear whether neurogenesis apprecia-
bly affects cognition in the aging hu-
man brain, but mouse studies indicate
that strategies that boost neurogenesis
can enhance cognitive function.

**Chemical Changes**
The amount of neurotransmit-
ters and the number of their recep-
tors might also decline with age.
Several studies have reported that


less dopamine is synthesized in the
aged brain, and there are fewer re-
ceptors to bind the neurotransmitter.
Less robust evidence indicates that
the amount of serotonin might also
decline with age.



WHY DOES THE BRAIN AGE?
From cortical thinning to the
loss of dendritic spines, you’ve
seen how the brain ages. But what
causes these changes? Many different
theories have been advanced to
explain why neurons, and cells in



general, age. One possibility is that
changes in gene expression play a role.
Researchers have found that genes
important for synaptic plasticity are
expressed less in the brains of older
people than in the brains of younger
adults. The underexpressed genes also
showed more signs of damage.



Oxidative Stress
and DNA Damage
DNA damage that accumulates
over a lifetime could contribute
to aging processes throughout the
brain and body, and DNA damage
due to oxidative stress has received a
great deal of attention. Every cell in



your body contains organelles called
mitochondria, which function a bit
like cellular power plants, carrying
out chemical reactions that provide
energy for cell use. Some of these
metabolic reactions produce harmful
byproducts called free radicals, highly
reactive molecules which, if left un-
checked, can destroy fats and proteins
vital to normal cell function and can
damage DNA as well.
Your body has natural defense
mechanisms to neutralize free radi-
cals. Unfortunately, these mechanisms
decline with age, leaving aging tissues
more vulnerable to oxidative damage
by the free radicals. Studies of brain
cells have shown that damage to their
mitochondrial DNA accumulates with
age. In addition, the brains of people
with mild cognitive impairment and
Alzheimer’s disease show more signs
of oxidative damage than the brains of
healthy people. Studies in rodents also
link increased oxidative damage to
memory impairments.
Your brain is one of the most
metabolically active organs, demand-
ing around 20 percent of the body’s
fuel. Its enormous energy require-
ments might make the brain even
more vulnerable than other tissues
to the metabolic changes that occur
in aging. While the brain’s energy
demands remain high, its energy
supply can no longer keep pace; the
brain’s ability to take up and use glu-
cose diminishes and mitochondrial
metabolism declines.



Immune Dysfunction
Immune dysfunction often occurs
in conjunction with the metabolic
changes seen in aging. Microglia, the
brain’s resident immune cells, per-
form many important jobs: defending
against pathogens, cleaning up cellular


Many different theories have been

advanced to explain why neurons,

and cells in general, age.

**Adult & Aging Brain 8**

debris, and helping maintain and re-
model synapses. These inflammatory
responses are protective, but a pro-
longed inflammatory state is harmful
to brain health. Microglia become
more reactive with age, increasing the
inflammatory response in the brain
while also damping production of
helpful anti-inflammatory molecules.
Mouse studies suggest that excessive
microglial activity also contributes to
cognitive impairments.

**Impaired Protein Recycling**
We know that excessive buildup
of abnormal proteins in the brain
contributes to age-related neurode-
generative diseases like Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s. Buildup of proteins
and other cell components can also
contribute to cellular degeneration
in the healthy brain. Cells normally


break down and recycle damaged
proteins and molecules, using a pro-
cess that is usually efficient but not
perfect. Over time, damaged mole-
cules can build up in cells and prevent
them from functioning normally.
Because neurons in the brain are not
replaced as often as cells in other
parts of the body (for example, bone
marrow, intestinal lining, hair folli-
cles), brain cells might be even more
vulnerable to this buildup of damaged
molecules. Also, the cellular ma-
chinery involved in breakdown and
recycling processes degrades with age,
reducing the efficiency of the “waste
removal” systems.
Finally, remember that changes
in the aging brain occur within the
context of other changes throughout
the body. Researchers speculate that
worsening cardiovascular health, for



example, could contribute to, or even
drive, many changes seen in the
aging brain.



HEALTHY AGING
We have learned how
the brain changes with
age and why these changes can occur.
Now let’s turn our attention to a
growing field in neuroscience that
explores ways to slow these changes
and preserve healthy brain function.



Diet and Exercise
Strong evidence now suggests
that habits and choices that keep your
body healthy also benefit your mind.
Poor cardiovascular health puts a
person at increased risk of age-related
cognitive impairment. Diets rich in
vegetables, fruits, and whole grains,
and low in meat and dairy products,
can reduce cardiovascular risk factors
linked to cognitive impairment, such
as high blood pressure and high levels
of LDL cholesterol. Indeed, observa-
tional studies have found that people
who follow plant-rich diets such as
the Mediterranean diet or Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) are less likely to develop
cognitive decline and dementia.
Specific nutrients have been linked
to improved cognitive performance
and lower rates of dementia. Anti-
oxidants, such as vitamins C and E,
flavonoids, and omega-3 fatty acids
have received considerable attention,
with observational studies showing
that high dietary intake of these
compounds is beneficial. However,
the results of lifestyle intervention
studies using supplements have been
more mixed. Finally, caloric restriction
— substantially reducing the number
of calories eaten without leading to
malnutrition — has been linked to


Synapses begin to weaken as a person ages, which can contribute to normal
cognitive decline.

improved cognitive health as well as a
longer lifespan.
Growing evidence shows that
aerobic exercise can improve cognitive
function and offset some of the de-
clines seen in aging. Numerous studies
have found that people who engage
in regular physical activity show
improved learning, improved mem-
ory, and a reduced risk of developing
dementia. Physical activity might even
slow the progression of Alzheimer’s
disease and dementia, and higher levels
of physical activity have been linked
to improvements in some markers of
structural brain health, such as reduced


cortical thinning and less shrinkage in
the hippocampus.
Exercise exerts its neuroprotec-
tive effects in the brain by improving
neuroplasticity — the brain’s ability to
form and reorganize connections be-
tween neurons in response to changes
in behavior and environment. Scien-
tists also believe that exercise increases
neurogenesis (the formation of new
nerve cells) which, in turn, enhances
neuroplasticity. Evidence from rodent
studies confirms that exercise increases
neurogenesis: Older mice allowed to
run on a wheel have higher rates of
neurogenesis in the hippocampus than



sedentary mice, and they perform bet-
ter on learning and memory tests. Ex-
ercise can also improve blood flow and
increase production of neurotrophic
factors that support new neurons and
synapses. For humans, starting exercise
later in life can be beneficial, but the
studies suggest that adopting an exer-
cise program earlier in life could yield
even more neuroprotective benefits.



Mental Stimulation
and Social Networks
Mental stimulation and large so-
cial networks can also improve cogni-
tive function in aging. In lab studies,
mice housed in cognitively stimulat-
ing environments with many oppor-
tunities for social interaction perform
better on learning and memory tests
as they age compared to mice housed
in standard cages. Much like physical
exercise, cognitive stimulation appears
to enhance neuroplasticity by increas-
ing neurogenesis and boosting levels
of important neurotrophic factors.
People who perform cognitive-
ly-demanding work or engage in
stimulating activities such as reading,
solving puzzles, or playing a musical
instrument have lower rates of cog-
nitive decline with aging. An active
social life has also been shown to be
beneficial for cognition as we age.
Neuroscientists have learned a
lot about the aging brain — how it
changes, why it changes, and how
to maintain healthy cognitive func-
tioning as we age. Even so, many
questions remain. Answers to those
questions could identify new strate-
gies for protecting the brain, not only
in our later years, but throughout
our lives.


Exercise has been shown to increase neurogenesis in the adult brain, and can slow the
cognitive decline associated with aging.

ave you ever considered the
ups and downs that occur
during your day? Speaking
literally, you are up and awake during
the day and lying down sleeping at
night. Speaking figuratively, ups and
downs could mean that you experi-
ence periods of elevated alertness and
arousal compared with your mood when
you are tired or relaxed. Asleep, awake,
aroused, and relaxed are different brain
states, meaning that the brain’s activity
is different during each of these peri-
ods. Scientists have looked deep inside
the brain to understand what sleep is
and how rest differs from being alert.
This research is especially important
for people like doctors, pilots, and shift
workers who sometimes must focus and
make important decisions with very little
sleep. Research on brain states can also
help people who have disorders of sleep,
attention, and learning.



SLEEP
How many hours of sleep do you
get every night? Most people spend
one-third of their lives asleep. While
that might appear to be a lot of time
spent doing nothing, our brains are
active while we rest each night. The
activity in our brains during sleep is
important for brain health and for
solidifying memories.
Most people feel tired and un-
able to focus if they don’t get enough
sleep. In some cases, too little sleep
can impair a person’s driving as much
as drinking alcohol. The long-term ef-
fects of lacking sleep also involve many
health risks. Several studies in humans
have revealed that sleep-deprived
people are at increased risk for a wide
range of health issues including diabe-
tes, stress, obesity, high blood pres-
sure, anxiety, cognitive impairment,
and depression.

**Brain Activity During Sleep**
Scientists can measure the brain’s
electrical activity using electroenceph-
alography (EEG). Electrodes attached
to the scalp detect and record the net
electrical activity of hundreds of thou-
sands of cortical nerve cells. When a
neuron is active, ions move in and out
of the cell, altering the electrical charge
across the cell membrane. An EEG de-
tects the net electrical charge produced
when neurons increase and decrease
their activity as a group, in synchrony.
The results are “brain waves” — the
cyclic rising and falling of brain activ-
ity that can be important indicators of
brain function. In sleep studies, scien-
tists now recognize two main states:
slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye
movement sleep (REM).
SWS gets its name from the
high amplitude, low frequency,
brain waves in EEG recordings.
The high amplitude of slow waves
indicates that many cortical neu-
rons are switching their activity in a


synchronized way from a depolarized
(more excitable) state to a hyperpo-
larized (less excitable) state and back
again. These slow waves appear to
be important to sleep function —
the longer a person stays awake, the
more slow waves they will experience
during the SWS state. Slow waves
become less frequent the longer the
person is asleep. If awakened during
SWS, most people recall only frag-
mented thoughts, not active dreams.
Have you ever seen a cat dream-
ing — twitching its whiskers or paws
while it sleeps? Dreaming happens
mainly during REM sleep, which takes
its name from the periodic rapid eye
movements people make in this state.
Brain activity recorded during REM
looks very similar to EEGs recorded
while awake. EEG waves during REM
sleep have much lower amplitudes
than the SWS slow waves, because
neuron activity is less synchronized
— some nerve cells depolarize while
others hyperpolarize, and the “sum” of



their electrical states is less positive (or
negative) than if they acted in synchro-
ny. Paradoxically, the fast, waking-like
EEG activity during REM sleep is ac-
companied by atonia, a loss of muscle
tone causing the body to become tem-
porarily paralyzed. The only muscles
remaining active are those that enable
breathing and control eye movements.
Oddly enough, the neurons of our
motor cortex fire as rapidly during
REM sleep as they do during waking
movement — a fact that explains why
movements like a kitten’s twitching
paws can coincide with dreams.
During the night, periods of
SWS and REM sleep alternate in
90-minute cycles with 75–80 minutes
of SWS followed by 10–15 minutes
of REM sleep. This cycle repeats,
typically with deeper and longer peri-
ods of REM sleep towards morning.
To study sleep disorders, researchers
often use mice that have sleep struc-
tures qualitatively very similar to hu-
mans; however, rodents have shorter

and more frequent sleep episodes
lasting 3–30 minutes (sometimes lon-
ger). Rodents also sleep more during
the day and are more active at night.
Compare that to human adults, who
are typically more active during the
day and have one sleep episode at
night lasting about 8 hours.

**Sleep Regulation**
How does the brain keep us
awake? Wakefulness is main-
tained by the brain’s arousal systems,
each regulating different aspects of the
awake state. Many arousal systems are
in the upper brainstem, where neurons
connecting with the forebrain use the
neurotransmitters acetylcholine,
norepinephrine, serotonin, and

glutamate to keep us awake. Orexin-
producing neurons, located in the
hypothalamus, send projections to the
brainstem and spinal cord, the thala-
mus and basal ganglia, as well as to the
forebrain, the amygdala, and dopa-
mine-producing neurons. In studies of
rats and monkeys, orexin appears to
exert excitatory effects on other arousal
systems. Orexins (there are two types,
both small neuropeptides) increase
metabolic rate, and their production


can be activated by insulin-induced
low blood sugar. Thus, they are
involved in energy metabolism. Given
these functions, it comes as no surprise
that orexin-producing neurons are
important for preventing a sudden
transition to sleep; their loss causes
narcolepsy, as described below. Orexin
neurons also connect to hypothalamic
neurons containing the neurotransmit-
ter histamine, which plays a role in
staying awake.
The balance of neurotransmitters
in the brain is critically important for
maintaining certain brain states. For
example, the balance of acetylcholine
and norepinephrine can affect wheth-
er we are awake (high acetylcholine
and norepinephrine) or in SWS (low



acetylcholine and norepinephrine).
During REM, norepinephrine re-
mains low while acetylcholine is high,
activating the thalamus and neocortex
enough for dreaming to occur; in
this brain state, forebrain excitation
without external sensory stimuli pro-
duces dreams. The forebrain becomes
excited by signals from the REM
sleep generator (special brainstem
neurons), leading to rapid eye move-
ments and suppression of muscle



tone — hallmark signs of REM.
During SWS, the brain systems
that keep us awake are actively sup-
pressed. This active suppression of
arousal systems is caused by the ven-
trolateral preoptic (VLPO) nucleus, a
group of nerve cells in the hypothala-
mus. Cells in the VLPO release the in-
hibitory neurotransmitters galanin and
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
which can suppress the arousal sys-
tems. Damage to the VLPO nucleus
causes irreversible insomnia.



Sleep-Wake Cycle
Two main factors drive your body
to crave sleep: the time of day or night
(circadian system) and how long you
have been awake (homeostatic system).
The homeostatic and circadian systems
are separate and act independently.
The circadian timing system is
regulated by the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, a small group of nerve cells
in the hypothalamus that functions
as a master clock. These cells express
“clock proteins,” which go through a
biochemical cycle of about 24 hours,
setting the pace for daily cycles of
activity, sleep, hormone release, and
other bodily functions. The master
clock neurons also receive input
directly from the retina of the eye.
Thus, light can reset the master clock,
adjusting it to the outside world’s
day/night cycle — this explains how
your sleep cycles can shift when you
change time zones during travel. In
addition, the suprachiasmatic nucleus
sends signals through different brain
regions, eventually contacting the
VLPO and the orexin neurons in the
lateral hypothalamus, which directly
regulate arousal.
What happens in the brain when
we don’t get enough sleep? The second
system that regulates sleepiness is the

homeostatic system, which makes you
feel sleepy if you stay awake longer
than usual. One important sleep
factor is a chemical in the brain called
adenosine. When you stay awake for
a long time, adenosine levels in the
brain increase. The increased ade-
nosine binds to specific receptors on
nerve cells in arousal centers to slow
cellular activity and reduce arousal.
Adenosine can increase the number of
slow waves during SWS. As you get
more sleep, adenosine levels fall and
slow waves decrease in number. Caf-
feine acts as a stimulant by binding to
adenosine receptors throughout the
brain and preventing their interaction
with adenosine. As a result, in the
presence of caffeine, fewer receptors
are available for the slowing influence
of adenosine.
People often say they need to
“catch up on sleep.” But can you really
make up for lost sleep? Normally, the
homeostatic and circadian systems
act in a complementary fashion to
produce a normal 24-hour cycle of
sleep and wakefulness. Nonetheless,
activating the brain’s arousal system
can keep us awake even after a long pe-
riod of wakefulness — for example, a
late-night study session to prepare for
an important exam. In normal circum-
stances, the homeostatic system will
respond to the loss of sleep by increas-
ing the duration of ensuing sleep and
increasing the number of slow waves
during the SWS episodes. As noted
above, this rebound slow wave activity
correlates with the previous time spent
awake and is mediated by adenosine.

**Sleep Disorders**
The most common sleep disorder,
and the one most people are familiar
with, is insomnia. Some people with
insomnia have difficulty falling asleep


initially; others fall asleep, then awak-
en part way through the night and
can’t fall back asleep. Several common
disorders, listed below, disrupt sleep
and prevent people from getting an
adequate amount of sleep.
Daytime sleepiness (not narcolep-
sy), characterized by excessive feelings
of tiredness during the day, has many
causes including sleep apnea (see be-
low). Increased daytime sleepiness can
increase the risk of daytime accidents,
especially car accidents.
Sleep apnea occurs when the air-
way muscles of the throat relax during
sleep, to the point of collapse, closing
the airway. People with sleep apnea
have difficulty breathing and wake up
without entering the deeper stages of
SWS. This condition can cause high
blood pressure and may increase the
risk of heart attack. Treatments for
sleep apnea focus on reducing airway
collapse during sleep; simple changes
that may help include losing weight,
avoiding alcohol or sedating drugs
prior to sleep, and avoiding sleeping
on one’s back. However, most people



with sleep apnea require breathing
machines to keep their airway open.
One such device, called a continuous
positive airway pressure or “CPAP”
machine, uses a small mask that fits
over the nose to provide an airstream
under pressure during sleep. In some
cases, people need surgery to correct
their airway anatomy.
REM sleep behavior disorder
occurs when nerve pathways in the
brain that prevent muscle movement
during REM sleep do not work.
Remember that dreaming happens
during REM sleep, so imagine people
literally acting out their dreams by
getting up and moving around. This
can be very disruptive to a normal
night’s sleep. The cause of REM be-
havior disorder is unknown, but it is
more common in people with degen-
erative neural disease such as Parkin-
son’s, stroke, and types of dementia.
The disorder can be treated with
drugs for Parkinson’s or with a ben-
zodiazepine drug, clonazepam, which
enhances the effects of the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA.

Electroencephalography measures brain activity through sensors placed on the head. It can
record how the brain reacts to all kinds of stimuli and activities, including sleep.

**Narcolepsy: An Example
of Sleep Disorder Research**
Narcolepsy is a relatively
uncommon sleep disorder —
only 1 case per 2,000 people in the
United States — in which the brain
lacks the special neurons that help
control the transition into sleep, so
that the regular cycling is disrupted.
People with narcolepsy have sleep
attacks during the day, causing them
to suddenly fall asleep, which is
especially dangerous if they are
driving. The problem is caused by the
loss of orexin neurons in the lateral
hypothalamus. People with narcolep-
sy tend to enter REM sleep very
quickly and may even enter a dream-
ing state while still partially awake, a
condition known as hypnagogic
hallucination. Some people with
narcolepsy also have attacks in which
they lose muscle tone — similar to
what happens in REM sleep, but
while they’re awake. These attacks of
paralysis, known as cataplexy, can be
triggered by emotional experiences
and even by hearing a funny joke.
Recent research into the mech-
anisms of narcolepsy has provided
important insights into the processes
that control the mysterious transitions
between waking, slow wave sleep,
and REM sleep states. Orexin (in the
lateral hypothalamus) is critical for
preventing abnormal transitions into
REM sleep during the day. In one
study, scientists inactivated the gene
for orexin in mice and measured their
sleep patterns. They found that mice
lacking the orexin gene showed symp-
toms of narcolepsy. Similarly, humans
with narcolepsy have abnormally low
levels of orexin levels in their brain
and spinal fluid.
Because orexin levels are disrupt-
ed in narcolepsy, scientists also began


studying neurons that were neighbors
to orexin neurons to see what hap-
pened if the neighboring neurons were
activated in narcoleptic mice. Those
neurons contained melanin-concen-
trating hormone, and stimulating
them (using a technique called opto-
genetics) induced sleep — opposite to
the effect of stimulating orexin neu-
rons. A balance between the activation
of orexin neurons and their neighbor-
ing neurons could control the tran-
sition between waking and sleeping.
These findings will be important in
developing treatments for narcolepsy.



AROUSAL
Think about what happens in
your body and mind when you speak
in front of a crowd — your brain
state is very different from when
you are asleep. Perhaps you notice
changes in your breathing, heart rate,
or stomach. Maybe your thoughts are
racing or panicked. Or maybe you
are energized and excited to perform
for your audience. These are exam-
ples of the complex brain state
called arousal.
Rather than merely being awake,
arousal involves changes in the body
and brain that provide motivations
to do an action — teaching a class,
speaking in public, or focusing your
attention. People experience arousal
daily when searching for food while
hungry, or when talking with other
people (social interaction). Arousal is
also important for reproduction and
for avoiding danger.
The level of arousal varies across
a spectrum from low to high. When
arousal falls below a certain threshold
we can transition from wake to sleep,
for example. But under heightened
arousal, like intense anxiety, we cannot
reach this threshold and we stay awake.



Neurotransmitters
During arousal, the brain must de-
vote resources to specific brain regions,
much as an emergency call center
redirects resources like ambulances
and fire trucks during a fire. Specific
types of neurons in the brain regions
involved in arousal release multiple
neurotransmitters, telling the rest of
the brain and the body to be on alert.
These neurotransmitters are dopamine
(for movement), norepinephrine (for
alertness), serotonin (for emotion),
and acetylcholine and histamine,
which help the brain communicate
with the body to increase arousal.



Sensory Input
While neurotransmitters provide
the internal signals for arousal, external
signals from the outside world — like
the bright lights (visual input) and
cheering crowds (auditory input) at a
stage performance — can also stimu-
late arousal. Sensory input gets sorted
in the brain region called the thala-
mus. Often called a “sensory clearing
house,” the thalamus regulates arous-
al, receiving and processing sensory
inputs from brain regions important
in senses like vision and hearing and
relaying these inputs to the cortex.



Autonomic Nervous System
Once the brain is aroused, what
does the body do? The reticular
activating system, in the brainstem, co-
ordinates signals coming from sensory
inputs and neurotransmitters to make
sense of events in the brain and pass
that information to the rest of the
body. The reticular activating system
specifically controls the autonomic
nervous system, which affects heart
rate, blood flow, and breathing. By
controlling these automatic body pro-
cesses, the reticular activating system


### 64 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**9 Brain States**

sets up the physical state of arousal,
bringing important resources like oxy-
gen and nutrients to parts of the body
where they are needed.
Together, the changes that happen
in the brain and body during arous-
al enable us to be alert and focused,
which helps us process information
quickly. Using this information, we
can choose the appropriate emotional
response or physical action for a
given situation.

**Sexual Arousal**
Several complex brain systems and
endocrine (hormone) systems contrib-
ute to sexual arousal and behaviors, but
the brain regions, neurotransmitters,
and body systems are similar to those
involved in general arousal. The dis-
tinguishing factor is that sexual arousal
also involves hormones such as estrogen
and testosterone, which then activate
neurons that release the same neu-
rotransmitters that are released during
general arousal. Many human and ani-
mal studies report interactions between
sex hormones and neurotransmitters
dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and
glutamate. Researchers have also found
that brain regions such as the hypo-
thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus
contain many estrogen and progester-
one receptors, and brain regions that
mediate feelings of reward (nucleus
accumbens) and emotions like pleasure
(amygdala) motivate sexual behaviors.
Overall, the primary involvement of sex
hormones is a key in defining the brain
state of sexual arousal.

**ATTENTION**
If you are paying
attention right now,
there should be detectable changes in
your heart rate, breathing, and blood
flow. If that sounds familiar, it’s


because those same physiological
changes occur during arousal, which
is necessary for being alert and paying
attention. As mentioned previously,
the state of arousal calls for reactions
to the environment. To make deci-
sions about what to do, you need to
focus on what’s happening in the
environment, especially involving



anything relevant to your goals. For
example, if your goal is to run away
from an angry bear, you need to be
alert and pay attention to where
you’re running so you don’t trip and
fall. Scientists have theorized that the
state of arousal speeds processing and
improves comprehension of environ-
mental details. Otherwise, your brain
would need an infinite amount of
time and energy to process all of its
sensory inputs (sounds, sights, smells,
and other feelings), because the
environment is always changing.



Focus
Even with multitasking, it is
impossible for the brain to process
all its sensory inputs. Instead, people
focus their attention on one thing at
a time. Attention is a fascinating abil-
ity, because it enables you to have so
much control and the ability to fine-



tune your focus to different locations,
times, and topics. Consider the page
you are reading right now. Although
you can see the whole page, you focus
on only one line at a time. Alterna-
tively, you can turn your attention
to the past — just minutes ago when
you were reading about arousal. Or
you can ignore the sentences alto-



gether and focus on the number of
times the word “you” occurs on this
page. Scientists recognize two types
of attention, which involve different
brain processes: voluntary (endog-
enous) attention and involuntary
(exogenous) attention.
Voluntary attention happens
when you choose what to focus on —
like finding a loved one in a crowd.
The frontal and parietal cortices of
the brain are active when you control
your attention or direct it towards a
specific object or location. Involun-
tary attention occurs when something
in the environment (like a sudden
noise or movement) grabs your atten-
tion. Involuntary attention is a dis-
traction from your chosen goals and,
in fact, researchers often use distrac-
tor objects in attention experiments.
Distractors can be emotional, like
pictures of family, or non-emotional

images that stand out from other
stimuli, like a red circle surrounded
by gray squares. Brain regions in the
right hemisphere, collectively known
as the ventral frontoparietal network,
form a system that processes new and
interesting stimuli that distract you
from the task at hand. Research on at-
tention can help us understand visual
tasks, learning, child development,
and disorders of attention.

**Disorders of Attention**
Paying attention for long
periods of time, such as a
3-hour lecture, can be difficult for
many people. For some people, even
focusing for a short time can be hard.
Several disorders that affect the ability
to pay attention are attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
schizophrenia, prosopagnosia, and
hemineglect syndrome. It may seem
strange to regard schizophrenia as an
attention disturbance, but some
psychiatric studies suggest that it
involves a failure of selective attention.
Prosopagnosia, or face blindness, is a
cognitive disorder in which a person is
unable to recognize faces — even their
own family members. The severity of
this condition varies, and genetic
factors might be involved. Attention
disorders have various causes, but we
will focus on hemineglect syndrome,
caused by damage to the right parietal
cortex, a brain region important in
involuntary attention.
Between 50–82 percent of pa-
tients who suffer stroke in the right
hemisphere experience hemineglect
syndrome, also known as spatial ne-
glect and unilateral neglect. In these
cases, patients with neglect ignore the
left side of their visual field. Some-
times they ignore the left side of the
body and the left side of individual


objects, as well. Diagnosis of hemine-
glect syndrome can be done with a
pen and paper. For example, patients
can be instructed to draw a copy of
a picture like a butterfly or a castle,
and those patients with hemineglect
usually draw only the right half of
the picture or leave out details of the
left side. Research on patients with
hemineglect syndrome contributes to
our understanding of rehabilitation
after stroke, as well as the role of the
right parietal cortex in attention
and perception.



REST: DEFAULT MODE
NETWORK
What is the difference
between being alert
and resting while awake? During times
of rest and relaxation, you’re usually
avoiding heavy thinking or complicat-
ed tasks, and parts of the brain called
the default mode network are more
active. You may think of the default
mode network as a personal lullaby or
a playlist that turns on when you are
ready to relax. Activity of the default
mode network decreases (the lullaby
gets quieter) when you start doing or
thinking about a demanding task.
Human studies using imaging tech-
niques such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and
positron emission tomography (PET)
have identified which brain regions
belong to the default mode network.
These brain areas, which are involved
in emotion, personality, introspection,
and memory, include frontal brain
regions (ventromedial prefrontal
cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex,
and anterior cingulate cortex), as well
as the posterior cingulate cortex, lateral
parietal cortex, and precuneus.
Although the exact role of the
default mode network is unclear,



the functions of its “participating”
brain regions provide hints about its
purpose. Studies on emotion have
revealed that activity in the ventro-
medial PFC is directly related to
how anxious a subject feels while
performing a task — suggesting that
the default mode network may play a
role in regulating emotion and mood.
Activity in the dorsomedial PFC (a
region involved in self-referential
or introspective thoughts) increases
when a person is at rest and day-
dreaming. The dorsomedial PFC is
also involved in stream-of-conscious-
ness thoughts and thoughts about
oneself in the past, present, or future
(autobiographical self ). The roles of
these regions suggest that the default
mode network may also function
in self-reflection and our sense of
self in time.
The posterior brain regions of the
default mode network (posterior cin-
gulate cortex, lateral parietal cortex,
and precuneus) become more active
when remembering concrete mem-
ories from past experiences. These
brain regions are connected with the
hippocampus, which is important for
learning and forming memories. Both
the hippocampus and the default
mode network are more active when
a person is at rest in the evening and
less active when waking up early in
the day. These patterns indicate that
the default mode network helps to
process and remember the events
of the day.
Future studies using electrical re-
cordings from inside the human brain
can be paired with fMRI to tell us
more about the brain activity patterns
of the default mode network and how
brain regions coordinate their activity
during tasks that utilize the functions
of this network.


**T**


he cells of your body are
immersed in a constantly
changing environment. The
nutrients that sustain them rise and fall
with each meal. Gases, ions, and other
solutes flow back and forth between
your cells and blood. Chemicals bind
to cells and trigger the building and re-
lease of proteins. Your cells digest food,
get rid of wastes, build new tissues,
and destroy old cells. Environmental
changes, both internal and external,
ripple through your body’s physio-
logical systems. One of your brain’s
less-visible jobs is to cope with all these
changes, keep them within a normal
range, and maintain the healthy func-
tions of your body.
The tendency of your body’s tissues
and organ systems to maintain a condi-
tion of balance or equilibrium is called
homeostasis. Homeostasis depends
on active regulation, with dynamic
adjustments that keep the environ-
ment of your cells and tissues relatively
constant. The brain is part of many
homeostatic systems, providing signals
that coordinate your body’s internal
clocks and regulating hormone secre-
tion by the endocrine system. These
functions often involve a region of the
forebrain called the hypothalamus.



CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS
Almost every cell in your body
has an internal clock that tells
it when to become active, when to rest,
and when to divide. These clocks
broker changes in many of the body’s
physiological systems over a 24-hour,
or circadian, period. For example, the
clocks cause faster pulses of peristaltic
waves in your gut during the day and
make your blood pressure dip at night.
But because these clocks are deep
inside your body and cannot detect
daylight, none of them can tell time

on its own. Instead, daily rhythms are
coordinated by the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN), a tiny group of
neurons in the hypothalamus.
Neurons in the SCN act like a met-
ronome for the rest of the body, emit-
ting a steady stream of action potentials
during the day and becoming quiet
at night. The shift between active and
silent states is controlled by cyclic in-
teractions between two sets of proteins
encoded by your body’s “clock” genes.
Researchers first identified clock genes
in the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_
and studied how they keep time; since
then, a nearly identical set of genes has
been found in mammals. The SCN also
tracks what time it is based on signals
it receives from photoreceptors in the
retina, which keeps its activity in sync
with the Earth’s _actual_ day/night cycle.
That little nudge is very important be-
cause, on their own, clock proteins take
slightly _more_ than 24 hours to complete
a full cycle. Studies of animals deprived
of light have discovered that they go to
sleep and wake up a bit later each day.
An autonomic neural pathway
ties the daily rhythmic activity of the
SCN directly to other clocks in the
body. Neurons in the SCN stimulate an
adjacent region of the brain called the
paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which
in turn sends signals down a chain of
neurons through the spinal cord to the
peripheral organs of the body. You’ve al-
ready learned how signals in part of this
neural pathway stimulate orexin neu-
rons to regulate the body’s sleep/wake
cycle. Related pathways also govern the
secretion of melatonin, a hormone that
influences sleep behaviors. Specifically,
electrical activity originating in the SCN
enters the PVN’s neural network and
sends signals up to the pineal gland, a
small pinecone-shaped gland embedded
between the cerebral hemispheres. The


pineal gland secretes melatonin into the
bloodstream at night. Melatonin binds
to cells in many tissues, and although
it has no direct effect on clock gene
expression in the SCN, its systemic
effects seem to reduce alertness and
increase sleepiness. Light exposure trig-
gers signals that stop melatonin secre-
tion, promoting wakeful behaviors.



Together, these signals keep all the
body’s clocks synchronized to the same
24-hour cycle. Coordinated body clocks
enable your body’s physiological systems
to work together at the right times.
When your body prepares to wake from
sleep, 1) levels of the stress hormone
cortisol peak in the blood, releasing
sugars from storage and increasing
appetite, and 2) core body temperature
begins to drift upwards, raising your
body’s metabolic rate. These events,
synchronized with others, prepare your
body for a new day’s activity.
Desynchronizing the body’s phys-
iological clocks can cause noticeable
and sometimes serious health effects.
You might have experienced a familiar
example of circadian rhythm distur-
bance: jet lag. After crossing many time
zones in a short time period, a person’s
patterns of wakefulness and hunger



are out of sync with day and night.
Exposure to the local day/night cycle
resets the brain and body, but it can
take several days to get fully resynchro-
nized. Circadian rhythms can also be
disturbed by situations like late-shift
jobs or blindness, which decouple nor-
mal daylight signals from wake/sleep
cycles. Long-term circadian disruptions



are associated with health problems
including weight gain, increased rates
of insomnia, depression, and cancers.



HORMONES,
HOMEOSTASIS,
AND BEHAVIOR
Neurons can quickly
deliver the brain’s
messages to precise targets in the body.
Hormones, on the other hand, deliver
messages more slowly but can affect a
larger set of tissues, producing large-
scale changes in metabolism, growth,
and behavior. The brain is one of the
tissues that “listens” for hormonal
signals — neurons throughout the
brain are studded with hormone
receptors — and the brain’s responses
play an important part in regulating
hormone secretion and changing
behaviors to keep the body systems in

equilibrium. The brain regions
involved in hormone release are called
the neuroendocrine system.
The hypothalamus oversees the
production and release of many hor-
mones through its close ties to the pi-
tuitary gland. The paraventricular and
supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus
send axons into the posterior part of
the pituitary gland; activation of spe-
cific neurons releases either vasopressin
or oxytocin into capillaries within the
pituitary. Both of these molecules act
as neurotransmitters inside the brain,
but they are also hormones that affect
distant tissues of the body. Vasopressin
(also called antidiuretic hormone) in-
creases water retention in the kidneys
and constricts blood vessels (vasocon-
striction). Oxytocin promotes uterine
contractions during labor and milk
release during nursing.
Other hypothalamic regions send
axons to a capillary-rich area above the
pituitary called the median eminence.
When these neurons are activated,
they release their hormones into the
blood. These releasing (and inhibiting)
hormones travel through local blood
vessels to the anterior pituitary, where
they trigger (or inhibit) secretion of
a second specific hormone. Of the
seven anterior pituitary hormones,
five are trophic hormones — these
travel in the bloodstream to stimulate
activity in specific endocrine glands
(thyroid, adrenal cortex, ovaries, etc.)
throughout the body. The remaining
two hormones act on non-endocrine
tissues. Growth hormone stimulates
the growth of bone and soft tissues,
and prolactin stimulates milk produc-
tion by the breasts. Hormones released
from the anterior pituitary influence
growth, cellular metabolism, emotion,
and the physiology of reproduction,
hunger, thirst, and stress.


Many hormones produced by
the pituitary and its target endocrine
glands affect receptors inside the brain
— thus, these hormones can alter
neuronal function and gene transcrip-
tion in the hypothalamus. The effect
is to reduce the amount of hormone
released by the hypothalamus when
those circuits become active. These
negative feedback loops enable precise
doses of hormones to be delivered to
body tissues, and ensure that the hor-



mone levels are narrowly regulated.
One of these three-hormone
cascades regulates reproduction in
mammals. Its underlying pattern is the
same in both sexes: 1) gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) from the
hypothalamus makes the anterior pi-
tuitary release 2) luteinizing hormone
(LH) and follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH), which in turn make the gonads
secrete 3) sex hormones and start the
development of mature eggs or sperm.



The neuroendocrine system maintains homeostasis, the body’s normal equilibrium, and
controls the response to stress. The adrenal gland releases the stress hormones norepineph-
rine, epinephrine, and cortisol, which quicken heart rate and prepare muscles for action.
Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) is released from the hypothalamus and travels to the
pituitary gland, where it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH
travels in the blood to the adrenal glands, where it stimulates the release of cortisol.

Sex hormones, in turn, attach to
receptors in the hypothalamus and an-
terior pituitary and modify the release
of the hypothalamic and pituitary
hormones. However, sex hormones
regulate these feedback loops differ-
ently in males and females.
Male sex hormones induce simple
negative feedback loops that reduce
the secretion of gonadotropin-releas-
ing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
and follicle stimulating hormone. The
interplay among these hormones creates
a repetitive pulse of GnRH that peaks
every 90 minutes. The waxing and wan-
ing of GnRH keeps testosterone levels
relatively steady within body tissues,
maintains male libido, and keeps the
testes producing new sperm each day.
Female feedback patterns are
more complex. Over the course of the
month-long menstrual cycle, female sex
hormones exert both positive and nega-
tive feedback on GnRH, FSH, and LH.
When circulating levels of the
female sex hormones estrogen and
progesterone are low, rising follicle
stimulating hormone levels trigger egg
maturation and estrogen production.
Rising estrogen levels induce luteiniz-
ing hormone levels to rise. As the levels
of female sex hormones rise, they exert
negative feedback on FSH secretion,
limiting the number of eggs that ma-
ture in a month, but positive feedback
on LH, eventually producing the LH
surge that triggers ovulation. After
ovulation, high serum levels of sex hor-
mones again exert negative feedback on
GnRH, FSH, and LH which in turn
reduces ovarian activity. Levels of fe-
male sex hormones therefore decrease,
allowing the cycle to start over again.
Many other hormones are not
regulated by the pituitary gland,
but are released by specific tissues in
response to physiological changes. The


brain contains receptors for many of
these hormones but, unlike pituitary
hormones, it does not directly regulate
their secretion. Instead, when these
hormones bind to receptors on neu-
rons, they modify the output of neural
circuits, producing behavioral changes
that have homeostatic effects. One
example of this is a pair of hormones
called leptin and ghrelin.
Leptin and ghrelin change eating
behavior by regulating food intake
and energy balance. Both hormones
affect hunger, and both are released
in response to changes in an animal’s
internal energy stores. However, they
have different effects on the circuits
they regulate. Ghrelin keeps the
body fed. Released by the wall of the
gastrointestinal tract when the stom-
ach is empty, ghrelin activates hunger
circuits in the hypothalamus that drive
a search for food. Once the stomach is
full, ghrelin production stops, reduc-
ing the desire to eat. In contrast, leptin
helps maintain body weight within a
set range. Leptin is produced by fat
cells and is released when fat stores are
large. When it binds to neurons in the
hypothalamus, leptin suppresses the
activity of hunger circuits and reduces
the desire to eat. As fat stores are used
up, leptin levels decline, driving be-
havior that makes an animal eat more
often and replenish its fat stores.



STRESS
Your body reacts in stereotyped
ways when you feel threatened. You
breathe faster, your heartbeat speeds
up, your muscles tense and prepare
for action. These reactions may have
helped our ancestors run from preda-
tors, but any stressful situation — ar-
guing with your parents, a blind date, a
looming deadline at work, abdominal
cramps, discovering your apartment



was robbed, trying karaoke for the first
time — has the potential to set them
off. Scientists call this reaction the stress
response, and your body turns it on to
some degree in response to any external
or internal threat to homeostasis.



The Stress Response
The stress response weaves togeth-
er three of the brain’s parallel com-
munication systems, coordinating the
activity of voluntary and involuntary
nervous systems, muscles, and metabo-
lism to achieve one defensive goal.
Messages sent to muscles through
the somatic (voluntary) nervous system
prime the body to fight or run from
danger (the fight-or-flight response).
Messages sent through the autonomic
(involuntary) nervous system redirect
nutrients and oxygen to those mus-
cles. The sympathetic branch tells the
adrenal medulla to release the hor-
mone epinephrine (also called adren-
aline), which makes the heart pump
faster and relaxes the arterial walls that
supply muscles with blood so they can
respond more quickly. At the same
time, the autonomic system’s parasym-
pathetic branch restricts blood flow
to other organs including the skin,
gonads, digestive tract, and kidneys.
Finally, a cascade of neuroendocrine
hormones originating in the hypothal-
amus and anterior pituitary circulates
in the bloodstream, affecting processes
like metabolic rate and sexual func-
tion, and telling the adrenal cortex to
release glucocorticoid hormones —
like cortisol — into the blood.
Glucocorticoid hormones bind to
many body tissues and produce wide-
spread effects that prepare the body to
respond to potential threat. These hor-
mones stimulate the production and
release of sugar from storage sites such
as the liver, making energy available to

muscles. They also bind to brain areas
that ramp up attention and learning.
And they help inhibit nonessential
functions like growth and immune
responses until the crisis ends.
It’s easy to imagine how (and why)
these physiological changes make your
body alert and ready for action. But
when it comes to stress, your body can’t
tell the difference between the danger
of facing down a bull elephant and the
frustration of being stuck in traffic.
When stress is chronic, whatever its
cause, your adrenal glands keep pump-

ing out epinephrine and glucocorti-
coids. Many animal and human studies
have shown that long-term exposure to
these hormones can be detrimental.

**Chronic Stress**
Overexposure to
glucocorticoids can
damage a wide range of physiological
systems. It can cause muscles to
atrophy, push the body to store energy
as fat, and keep blood sugar abnormal-
ly high — all of these can worsen the
symptoms of diabetes. Overexposure
to glucocorticoids also contributes to
the development of hypertension (high
blood pressure) and atherosclerosis


(hardening of the arteries), increasing
the risk of heart attacks. Because the
hormones inhibit immune system
function, they also reduce resistance to
infection and inflammation, some-
times pushing the immune system to
attack the body’s own tissues.
Chronic stress can also have specif-
ic negative effects on brain tissue and
function. Persistently high levels of
glucocorticoids inhibit neuron growth
inside the hippocampus, impairing the
normal processes of memory forma-
tion and recall. Stress hormones can



also suppress neural pathways that are
normally active in decision-making
and cognition, and speed the deteri-
oration in brain function caused by
aging. They may worsen the damage
caused by a stroke. And they can
lead to sleep disorders — cortisol is
also an important wakeful signal in
the brain, so the high cortisol levels
due to chronic stress may delay sleep.
Stress-induced insomnia can then start
a vicious cycle, as the stress of sleep
deprivation leads to the release of even
more glucocorticoids.
The effects of chronic stress may
even extend beyond a single indi-
vidual, because glucocorticoids play



important roles in brain development.
If a pregnant woman suffers from
chronic stress, the elevated stress hor-
mones can cross the placenta and shift
the developmental trajectory of her
fetus. Glucocorticoids are transcription
factors, which can bind to DNA and
modify which genes will be expressed
as proteins. Studies with animal mod-
els have shown that mothers with high
blood levels of glucocorticoids during
pregnancy often have babies with low-
er birth weights, developmental delays,
and more sensitive stress responses
throughout their lives.
Because metabolic stressors such as
starvation induce high glucocorticoid
levels, it’s been suggested that these
hormones might help prepare the fetus
for the environment it will be born
into. Tough, stressful environments
push fetuses to develop stress-sensitive
“thrifty” metabolisms that store fat eas-
ily. Unfortunately, these stress-sensitive
metabolisms increase a person’s risk of
developing chronic metabolic diseases
like obesity or diabetes, especially if they
subsequently grow up in lower-stress
environments with plentiful food.
The effects of stress can even be
passed to subsequent generations by
epigenetic mechanisms. Chronic stress
can change the markers on DNA
molecules that indicate which of the
genes in a cell are expressed and which
are silenced. Some animal studies
indicate that when changes in markers
occur in cells that develop into eggs or
sperm, these changes can be passed on
and expressed in the animal’s offspring.
Further research might reveal wheth-
er chronic stress has similar effects
in humans, and whether inheriting
silenced or activated genes contributes
to family histories of cancer, obesity,
cardiovascular, psychiatric, or neurode-
velopmental disease.


Chronic stress can also have

specific negative effects on brain

tissue and function.

#### AUTISM SPECTRUM

#### DISORDERS


Autism is often considered a
childhood condition, although
many of its symptoms persist lifelong.
Some people with autism also have
mood and anxiety disorders, seizures,
intellectual disability, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
However, more than 40 percent of
people with autism have normal or
above-average intelligence. With
symptoms that range from mildly to
severely disabling, autism is considered
a spectrum. Autism spectrum disorders
(ASD) are diagnosed based on two
main criteria: impaired social commu-
nication and interaction, and repetitive
behaviors or narrow, obsessive inter-
ests. For example, some people on the
autism spectrum are unable to speak,
while others are socially awkward but
highly articulate. Many adults with an
autism diagnosis think of their autism
as a strength — enabling or motivating
them to develop deep expertise in an
area or a different perspective on the
world — rather than a disorder that
needs to be cured.
Currently, 1 of every 68 American
8-year-olds is estimated to meet the
diagnostic criteria for an autism spec-
trum disorder. The prevalence of ASD
has risen dramatically since the 1970s,
but it is unclear whether changes to
diagnostic criteria and wider recogni-
tion of ASD have contributed to the
increase in diagnoses.
Four to five times more boys
than girls are diagnosed with autism,
although it is not clear whether some
of that pattern is because of underdi-
agnosis of girls. Environmental factors
such as parents having children later in
life, fever and infection during preg-
nancy, and premature birth have been

**11 Childhood Disorders**

linked to an increased risk of autism
in children. A huge number of studies
have found no connection between
childhood vaccination and the increase
in autism diagnoses.
Autism is believed to be at least
partially driven by genetics, but how
do scientists know that for sure? One
low-tech approach uses twin studies:
If one of a pair of identical twins
receives an autism diagnosis, the other
twin has greater than a 50 percent
chance of also being diagnosed with
ASD. Children who have an older
sibling on the spectrum also have a
higher likelihood of being diagnosed
with autism — nearly one in five also
receives a diagnosis of ASD.
The genetics of autism is very
complicated in most cases, involving
dozens (or more) of genes, leading
to a unique condition in nearly
every person. Recently, however,
high-throughput genomic analyses
have broadened the pool of potential
genes, revealed their roles in the body,
and suggested possible new therapies.
It appears that many genes, each
with a small effect, contribute to the
inheritance of most ASDs. But such
small effects make these genes hard to
identify in genome-wide association
studies. Scientists are now looking at
the rare variants associated with ASD.
These afflict fewer people with ASD,
but their effects are larger and easier to
detect. Some of these rare mutations
are in single genes whose impairment
is already known to cause intellectu-
al disability and social dysfunction.
These genes include FMR1 (codes for
fragile X mental retardation protein,
but its non-mutant form is needed
for normal cognitive development);
PTEN (codes for a tumor suppressor
enzyme that regulates cell division,
so cells don’t divide or grow too fast);


and TSC1 or TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis
complex 1 and 2), which also code for
proteins that help control cell growth
and size. Between 50 to 60 percent of
people with fragile X syndrome and
approximately 40 percent of people
with tuberous sclerosis complex have
ASD. Children with a variant of the
gene NF-1 develop tumors in child-
hood (neurofibromatosis) and a 2011
study found that nearly 10 percent
met the criteria for autism.
Intriguingly, these ASD-related
genes influence a major signaling
pathway for regulating cell metabo-
lism, growth, and proliferation, the
mTOR pathway. This suggests a very
real potential for treating autism with
drugs that target the mTOR pathway.



For example, mouse models with
mutations in PTEN show traits simi-
lar to humans with these gene vari-
ants: altered sociability, anxiety, and
repetitive behaviors. These behaviors
can be relieved or reversed by drugs
that inhibit the mTOR pathway.
Clinical trials of these drugs (rapamy-
cin and lovastatin) are underway.
Despite this progress, autism
genetics is so complicated that it can’t
be used to diagnose the condition.



And unlike diabetes, kidney disease, or
thyroid disease, there are no biochem-
ical or other biomarkers of autism.
Currently, autism diagnosis is based on
behavioral analysis, but efforts are un-
derway to use more objective criteria
such as tracking eye movements and
functional neuroimaging, which can
even be done in infants.
How early can autism be detect-
ed? Parents often notice develop-
mental issues before their child’s first
birthday, and autism can be reliably
diagnosed based on behavioral
characteristics at age 2. Despite these
possibilities for early detection, most
American children aren’t diagnosed
until they’re about 4½ years old. With
evidence mounting that interventions



are more effective the earlier they be-
gin, researchers are hoping that more
objective measures will enable earlier
diagnoses and interventions.
Although the molecular caus-
es and characteristics of autism are
unclear, it appears that the condition
results from unusual cellular develop-
ment within the cerebral cortex — a
brain region that is crucial to mem-
ory, attention, perception, language,
and other functions. Both white

and gray matter of the brain show
consistent, but subtle, alterations in
people with ASD. Long-term studies
also have found that a minority of
children on the autism spectrum have
abnormally large brain volumes and
faster brain growth. Other toddlers
with autism have shown unusual
development and network inefficien-
cies at the back of the cerebral cortex.
There is evidence that some atypical
activity occurs in the cortex of people
with ASD from older childhood into
adulthood, and information might
not be integrated in the usual way
across distributed brain networks.
At this point, no medications have
been proven to reverse autism. Some
people get symptomatic relief from
drugs designed for other uses, such as
anxiety conditions, and several stud-
ies have reported social benefits from
treatment with oxytocin — a hormone
known to improve social bonding —
but the findings have been mixed. For
this challenging disorder, behavioral
therapies are still the only proven treat-
ments for autism, and early interven-
tions are the most effective.

**ATTENTION DEFICIT
HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER**
Attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) is one of the most
commonly diagnosed childhood
conditions. In 2014, approximately
11 percent of American parents with
a child between the ages of 4 and 17
reported that their son or daughter
had received an ADHD diagnosis. In
at least 30 percent of those diagnosed
with ADHD, the disorder continues
into adulthood.
ADHD is usually characterized by
inattentiveness, as well as hyperactivity
or impulsive behaviors. Although all
young children can be hyperactive,


impulsive, and inattentive from time
to time, these symptoms are more
extreme and last longer in children
with ADHD. They often struggle to
form strong friendships, and their
grades in school can reflect their
behavior instead of their academic
ability. Executive functions, such as
finishing what they start, remembering
to bring homework back to school,
and following multistep directions, can
be especially challenging for those with
ADHD. Young people with ADHD
also have lower rates of high school
graduation and a higher risk of suicide.
No objective diagnostic test exists
for ADHD, so diagnosis requires a
comprehensive evaluation, including
a clinical interview and parent and
teacher ratings. Because problems
with attention and hyperactivity can
be caused by other conditions such as
depression, sleep issues, and learning
disorders, careful evaluation is always
needed to determine whether ADHD
is truly the cause of the symptoms. To
warrant an ADHD diagnosis, atten-
tion and behavioral problems must be
severe enough that they interfere with
normal functioning. In addition, the
behavioral issues must be present in
more than one context — not only at
home or at school, but in both settings.
Although ADHD tends to run in
families, no well-defined set of genes
is known to be responsible for the
condition. Environmental risk factors,
such as extreme early adversity, expo-
sure to lead, and low birthweight, can
also be involved. People with ADHD
do not demonstrate any obvious brain
alterations, but research has found that
people with ADHD might have dif-
ferences in the structure of brain cells
and in the brain’s ability to remodel
itself. Some people with ADHD show
unusual activity in brain cells that re-



lease dopamine, a chemical messenger
involved in rewarding behavior.
ADHD has no cure, but treat-
ments include drugs, behavioral
interventions, or both. Interestingly,
ADHD medications include stimu-
lants such as methylphenidate, as well
as newer, non-stimulant drugs. The
drugs are available in long-acting for-
mulations so children do not have to
interrupt the school day to take their
medication. Determining the right
drug and the right dose might require
a period of experimentation and sup-
port from a specialist, since dosage is
adjusted to how fast a child metaboliz-
es the drug, and to minimize the side
effects. Nevertheless, most children
with ADHD are diagnosed and treated
by their pediatricians. Effective behav-
ioral treatments include organizational
support, exercise, and meditation.



DOWN SYNDROME
Down syndrome is named for the
English physician who first described
it in 1866, but nearly 100 years passed
before scientists determined what
caused the condition: possessing an
extra copy of all or part of the 21st
chromosome. People with this syn-
drome have three copies of this genetic
material, instead of two. In some cases,
the extra copy, or trisomy, does not
occur in every cell, producing what’s
known as mosaicism. Currently, about
250,000 people in the United States
are living with Down syndrome.
There is no clear cause of the
genetic glitch, although maternal age
is a major risk factor for Down syn-
drome. Mothers older than 40 are 8.5
times more likely to have a child with
Down syndrome than mothers aged
20 to 24. Advanced paternal age has
also been linked to higher incidence
of Down syndrome.


### 74 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**11 Childhood Disorders**

Since late 2011, fetuses can be
screened for Down syndrome using the
mother’s blood. In the past, the risk of
test procedures meant that only older
mothers (whose likelihood of having a
Down syndrome child was known to
be higher) should be screened. Younger
mothers didn’t know until delivery
whether their child would have Down
syndrome. The new blood test, unlike
amniocentesis and chorionic villus
sampling, poses no risk to the baby, so
it can also be used for younger moth-
ers whose chance of having a child
with Down syndrome is quite small.
Children born with Down syn-
drome have distinctive facial features,
including a flattened face and bridge
of the nose, eyes that slant upward,
and small ears. They usually have small
hands and feet, short stature, and poor
muscle tone as well. The intellectual
abilities of people with Down syndrome
are typically low to moderate, although
some graduate from high school and
college, and many successfully hold
jobs. Other symptoms of Down
syndrome can include hearing loss and
heart defects, and virtually everyone
born with Down will develop early-on-
set Alzheimer’s disease, often in their
40s or 50s. Chromosome 21 contains
the gene that encodes amyloid precur-
sor protein (APP), an Alzheimer’s dis-
ease risk factor, and possessing an extra
copy of this gene might cause the early
onset of this fatal disease. Interestingly,
people with mosaic Down syndrome
seem to have milder symptoms and are
more likely to live past 50.
There is no real treatment for
Down syndrome, nor any clear expla-
nation of what occurs in the brain.
Poor connections among nerve cells in
the hippocampus, the part of the brain
involved in memory (and the first brain
area affected by Alzheimer’s disease),


are believed to be a key factor in brain
or intellectual differences in Down syn-
drome. Dysfunction in the mitochon-
dria, the cell’s power plants, might also
play a role in development of related
disorders that involve energy metabo-
lism, such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s.
Scientists have grown stem cells
from fetuses with Down syndrome and
used them to test potential treatments
and confirm which molecular path-
ways are involved in the condition. In
one such laboratory study, researchers
took a gene that normally inactivates
the second X chromosome in female
mammals and spliced it into a stem cell
that had three copies of chromosome


21. In these cells, the inactivation gene
    muted the expression of genes on the
    extra chromosome 21, believed to con-
    tribute to Down syndrome. Although
    this is a long way from any clinical ap-
    plications, the model is being used to
    test the changes and cellular problems
    that occur with the tripling of the 21st
    chromosome, in hopes of eventually
    finding a treatment.


DYSLEXIA
Dyslexia is the most common
and best-studied of the
learning disabilities, affecting as many
as 15 to 20 percent of all Americans.
People with dyslexia have a pro-
nounced difficulty with reading
despite having normal intelligence,
education, and motivation.
Symptoms include trouble with
pronunciation, lack of fluency, diffi-
culty retrieving words, poor spelling,
and hesitancy in speaking. People with
dyslexia might need more time to
respond orally to a question and might
read much more slowly than their peers.
Dyslexia is usually diagnosed in elemen-
tary school, when a child is slow to read
or struggling with reading. Although



reading skills and fluency can improve,
dyslexia persists lifelong.
Deciphering printed letters and
words and recalling their sounds and
meaning involves many areas of the
brain. Brain imaging studies indicate
these areas can be less well connected
in people with dyslexia. One of these
areas is a region on the left side of the
brain called the “word-form area,”
which is involved in the recognition of
printed letters and words. People with
dyslexia also show less brain activity in
the left occipitotemporal cortex, which
is considered essential for skilled read-
ing. Researchers believe that the brain
differences are present before the read-
ing and language difficulties become
apparent — although it is possible
that people with dyslexia read less and,
therefore, their brains develop less in
regions associated with reading. Those
with dyslexia appear to compensate for
reduced activity on the left side of the
brain by relying more heavily on the
right side.
Genetic analyses have revealed a
handful of susceptibility genes, with
animal models suggesting that these
genes affect the migration of brain
cells during development, leading to
differences in brain circuitry. Dyslexia
runs in families, with roughly half of
dyslexics sharing the condition with
a close relative. When one twin is
diagnosed with dyslexia, the second
twin is found to have the condition
55-70 percent of the time. But the
genetics of dyslexia is complex, and
likely involves a wide range of genes
and environmental factors.
Treatment for dyslexia involves
behavioral and educational interven-
tion, especially exercises like breaking
words down into sounds and linking
the sounds to specific letter patterns.
Some researchers use a child’s ability


### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 75

**Childhood Disorders 11**

to rapidly and automatically name
things as an early indicator of dyslexia.
This rapid automatic naming, and the
ability to recognize and work with the
sounds of language, are often impaired
in people with dyslexia. Both skills can
be used in preschoolers and kinder-
gartners to predict their later reading
skills. Research suggests that treat-
ments targeting phonology, as well as
multiple levels of language skills, show
the greatest promise.

#### EPILEPSY

If someone has two or more
seizures that cannot be explained by a
temporary underlying medical condi-
tion such as a high fever or low blood
sugar, their medical diagnosis will be
“epilepsy” — from the Greek words
meaning to “seize,” “attack,” or “take
hold of.” About 1 percent of Ameri-
can children and 1.8 percent of adults
have been diagnosed with this brain
disorder. Seizures result from irregular
activities in brain cells that can last
five or more minutes at a time. Some
seizures look like staring spells, while
others cause people to collapse, shake,


and become unaware of what is going
on around them. The pattern of symp-
toms and after-seizure brain recordings
using EEGs are used to distinguish
between different types of epilepsy and
determine whether the true cause of
the seizures is epilepsy or a different
medical condition.
Seizures are classified by where
they occur in the brain. General-
ized seizures affect both sides of the
brain. They include absence or petit



mal seizures, which can cause rapid
blinking or a few seconds of staring
into space, and tonic-clonic or grand
mal seizures, which can make some-
one fall, have muscle spasms, cry out,
and/or lose consciousness. Focal or
partial seizures are localized to one
area of the brain. A simple focal sei-
zure can cause twitching or a change
in sensation, triggering strange smells
or tastes. Complex focal seizures can
leave a person confused and unable
to answer questions or follow direc-
tions. A person can also have so-called
secondary generalized seizures, which
begin in one part of the brain but



spread to become generalized seizures.
In some patients with severe epilepsy,
multiple types of seizure can occur at
the same time.
Epilepsy has many possible causes
and thus is considered a spectrum
rather than a single disorder. Causes
include premature birth, brain trauma,
and abnormal development due to
genetic factors. Attributes of epilepsy
patients such as head size, movement
disorders, and family history suggest
that genetics is involved.
Seizures can also accompany or
cause intellectual or psychiatric prob-
lems. For example, some seizures may
suppress the growth of dendrites, leav-
ing the person emotionally unsettled
or less able to learn.
Treatments for epilepsy are direct-
ed toward controlling seizures with
medication or diet. For most patients,
a single medication is enough to
control seizures, although a significant
minority cannot get adequate control
from drugs. About half of epilepsy pa-
tients, particularly those with general-
ized epilepsy, can reduce their seizures
by eating a ketogenic diet, which relies
heavily on high-fat, low-carbohydrate
foods, although it’s unclear why this
diet is effective. For severe cases that
are not relieved by medication, doctors
might recommend surgery to remove
or inactivate the seizure-initiating part
of the brain. In the most severe cases,
if one side of the brain triggers sei-
zures on the other side, surgeons may
perform “split-brain surgery,” cutting
the corpus callosum, a thick band of
white matter that connects the two
sides of the brain. Once their seizures
are controlled, people with epilepsy
can resume their normal lives.


Epilepsy has many possible causes

and thus is considered a spectrum

rather than a single disorder.

**L**


ike many health conditions,
psychiatric disorders can be
caused by multiple factors.
Genes often play a role, with many
psychiatric disorders tending to run
in families. Yet having a close relative
with anxiety, schizophrenia, depres-
sion, or another psychiatric condition
does not mean that you will develop
the same problem. Many environmen-
tal effects, including life circumstanc-
es, medical conditions, and personal
relationships, also have an influence.
Environmental factors can be negative
— like the death of a loved one, pover-
ty, addiction, or being exposed directly
to violence such as military combat
— or they may be protective. These
so-called resilience factors include a
strong support system of family and
friends, good coping skills, being
physically active, and involvement in a
range of activities.



ANXIETY DISORDERS
AND POST-TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER
Everyone feels anxious at
times, and worrying is a
normal and healthy response to
uncertainty or potential danger. But
unhealthy, uncontrollable anxiety is
the common thread in a variety of
psychiatric disorders: post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder (OCD), and panic
attacks. Collectively, anxiety disorders
are the most common mental disorders
experienced by Americans. They are
more common in women, for reasons
that are not clear but likely include
both sex differences (biological) and
gender differences (psychosocial).
Medications used to treat most
anxiety disorders work by altering
the levels of neurotransmitters that
carry signals between brain regions.

### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 77

**Psychiatric Disorders 12**

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) raise serotonin levels, which
are known to be deficient in many
psychiatric conditions. Benzodiaze-
pines (such as diazepam, or Valium)
were once the standard medication
for anxiety because they boost levels
of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
GABA acts like a “brake pedal” on
neurons, helping to decrease their
activity, especially in areas of the
brain important in anxiety. However,
because of the risk of dependence,
benzodiazepines are no longer the first
choice for treatment of anxiety.

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**
OCD is a common, chronic con-
dition aptly named for its symptoms:
uncontrollable, recurring thoughts
(obsessions) and repeated, ritualistic
behaviors (compulsions) to banish,
relieve, or compensate for the obses-
sions. OCD affects about 1 percent of
U.S. adults, with an average age of 19
at diagnosis. Obsessions vary widely: A
person may, for example, worry about
getting sick from a contaminated
object, or feel the need to be “perfect”
all the time. Compulsions attempt to
counteract those thoughts behavioral-
ly — for example, by excessive hand
washing, or constantly checking for
mistakes or problems such as leaving
appliances on. Another type of OCD
is hoarding, provoked by the fear of
losing or forgetting important infor-
mation after discarding something.
People with OCD are burdened by
their obsessive thoughts and, although
compulsive behaviors can provide
relief, they do not bring pleasure.
Research studies that examine the
brain with powerful imaging tools have
enabled neuroscientists to define the
brain regions involved in obsessions


and compulsions. One such region,
the basal ganglia, connects with the
cortex to help control our ability to
move and think, but it also helps us
conduct routine behaviors that we
call habits. The basal ganglia are also
involved in the brain’s reward sys-
tem, our ability to feel good, and in
learning and memory; these functions
are mediated by the neurotransmitters
dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate,
respectively. Reward systems are often
dysfunctional in people with psychiat-
ric disorders, addiction, or both.
Researchers suspect that disrupted
signaling between the basal ganglia
and the cortex could set the stage for
ritualistic behaviors. Studies of repetitive
behaviors in mice have revealed electri-
cal activity that starts and ends in nerves
that connect these two brain regions.
The ability to manipulate, or “over-
ride,” those circuits may point the way
to breaking the obsession-compulsion
cycle in people with OCD.
About 70 percent of people
with OCD obtain limited relief with
medication, primarily SSRIs, but at
higher doses than are used for depres-
sion therapy. If SSRIs do not work
to control OCD, other approaches
include medications such as the tricy-
clic antidepressant clomipramine and
neuroleptic (tranquilizing) drugs, both
of which have significant side effects.
Cognitive behavioral therapy, a form
of counseling, can also be useful. Deep
brain stimulation (DBS) is a thera-
peutic approach used for people with
OCD who do not respond to stan-
dard drug or behavioral treatments.
DBS was first used about 30 years
ago to treat movement disorders like
Parkinson’s disease, but is now being
investigated for other uses. In DBS,
electrodes implanted at specific brain
locations emit high-frequency electrical



pulses intended to reset abnormal
neuronal firing. Scientists are begin-
ning to explore the use of DBS in the
basal ganglia and several other brain
regions to alleviate the symptoms
of OCD.



Panic Disorder
Panic disorder is a type of anxiety
disorder characterized by sudden,
unexpected bouts of intense, irra-
tional fear and frightening physical
symptoms such as difficulty breath-
ing, a racing heart, sweating, and
dizziness. It is more common than
OCD, affecting 2.7 percent of U.S.
adults and about the same proportion
of teens. Panic attacks typically last
several minutes or sometimes longer.
Because the attacks occur unpredict-
ably, people who experience them
often live in fear of having an attack
in public or while driving — further
increasing their anxiety. About half of
people with panic disorder also have
mood disorders such as depression or
bipolar disorder, as well as other psy-
chiatric illnesses like OCD, phobias,
and schizophrenia. Panic disorder is
usually treated with psychotherapy,
medications, or a combination of
these. SSRIs are the primary drugs
used for panic disorder, although
benzodiazepines can be used in an
emergency situation.



Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
PTSD is somewhat unique
among psychiatric disorders
because it has a well-defined cause: a
harrowing, traumatic event such as
military combat, a natural disaster, a
terrorist attack, a serious accident, or
physical or sexual assault as a child or
adult. PTSD can arise quickly after the
distressing event, but sometimes it can
take months to years for symptoms to

### 78

emerge. Symptoms are often severe
enough to interfere with relationships
or work. Some people have PTSD for
many years, experiencing flashbacks
and nightmares, intrusive memories of
the traumatic event, and hyperarousal
— feeling on edge and/or angry. To
compensate, individuals with PTSD
try to avoid trigger situations but
nonetheless may experience memory
loss, feelings of blame, and decreased
interest in everyday activities. Current-
ly, cognitive behavioral therapy is
thought to be the most effective
treatment for PTSD.
Neuroscientists have discov-
ered physiological changes in people
with PTSD. These changes include
increased heart rate and heightened
electrical sensitivity throughout the
skin and on the face in response to
audio or video triggers of traumatic
scenes like gunfire or other violence.
Simply recalling the initial traumatic
event can also bring on these symp-
toms. Another hallmark of PTSD is
shallow sleep with increased periods of
rapid eye movement, which can lead to
sleep deprivation over time. The body’s
general response to stress is maximal in
PTSD, with altered levels of hormones
such as cortisol and norepinephrine,
the primary fuels in the fight-or-flight
response to danger or fear. Not surpris-
ingly, PTSD treatment includes drugs
that block norepinephrine, such as the
blood-pressure medication prazosin
and beta-blocker drugs like propran-
olol. Scientists have also detected low
levels of other neurotransmitters, such
as serotonin, in people with PTSD,
leading to the use of SSRIs for treat-
ment. The neurotransmitter neuro-
peptide Y also appears to offer some
protection against developing PTSD.
Neuroimaging studies have begun
to reveal the neurobiological signatures


of PTSD, including changes in brain
structure. Many people with PTSD
have a smaller hippocampus (the brain
region integral for learning and memo-
ry) and a smaller prefrontal cortex (the
part of the brain that helps control
thinking, emotions, and behavior). In
contrast, the brain’s emotional center,
the amygdala, is apparently overactive



in responding to stimuli in people
with PTSD. Genes are involved in
PTSD susceptibility, but research
results are not yet conclusive regarding
the importance of their role or which
genes are involved. What is clear, how-
ever, is that genes affecting PTSD risk
also affect the risk for major depres-
sion, generalized anxiety disorder, and
panic disorder — suggesting common
biological components of these psychi-
atric conditions. Neuroimaging studies
that pinpoint brain regions disrupted
in PTSD support the development of
new drugs targeting neural function in
those regions. Among these drugs are
cannabinoids, glutamate, and oxyto-
cin — the latter, sometimes called the
“love” or “happiness” hormone, is re-
leased by both men and women during
orgasm and is secreted by mothers
during childbirth and breastfeeding.


#### MOOD DISORDERS


Mood is a vague term describ-
ing a person’s general state of
mind. You can easily recognize some-
one in a good mood and, likewise, in a
not-so-good mood. Your moods
change frequently with your emotional
state, and such changes are normal
when they suit your context and



surroundings. Mood disorders, on the
other hand, are mood changes that
become longer lasting and indepen-
dent of what is going on around you.
The two main mood disorders are
major depression and bipolar disorder.
In recent years, neuroscientists have
made major progress in linking genetic
and other biological contributors to
mood disorders and to disorders of
cognition, like schizophrenia. Hope-
fully, their findings will lead to better
treatments for people with more than
one such condition.



Major Depression
Diagnosis of major depression is
based on a set of criteria (at least four
must be met) that have persisted for at
least two weeks. These criteria include
feeling empty or sad, loss of appetite,
irritability, problems with sleep, and

**Psychiatric Disorders 12**

changes in appetite or weight. Like
anxiety, major depression is a common
psychiatric disorder that contributes
to considerable disability and death
worldwide. Often, depression is ac-
companied by other diseases. Various
medical and psychiatric conditions
(for example, diabetes, cancer, heart
disease, and addiction) are common
in people who are depressed, and de-
pression can make the other problems
worse. Nearly 7 percent of American
adults — about 16 million people —
have experienced at least one major
depressive episode in the past year, and
7 out of 10 of these are likely to be
female. This striking sex imbalance is
not thoroughly understood, but is an
area of active research.
Several factors combine to cause
depression: genes, biological risk
factors, environmental triggers, and
psychological influences. Many people
develop depression in response to the
stress of a difficult life experience or a
disabling medical problem such as can-
cer or chronic pain. Inside the brain,
depression appears to disrupt the
hypothalamus. This region secretes a
hormone that, via the pituitary gland,
tells the adrenal cortex to produce
more of the stress hormone cortisol.
The monoamine neurotransmitter
systems, which include dopamine and
serotonin, are also disrupted. Some
cases of depression — typically those
evoked by a stressful incident, situa-
tion, or short-term illness — respond
to treatment, and symptoms go away.
In many cases, though, depression
becomes a chronic condition and de-
pressive symptoms persist without any
outside influence.
As was also observed in people
with PTSD, people with depression
tend to have a smaller hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex. These two brain


areas help manage stress, but can be
damaged by excessive stress. When
researchers showed negative pictures to
depressed individuals and looked for
brain activation, they noted activity in
parts of the cortex linked to the limbic
system. Even though the burst of activ-
ity soon died down, individuals who
showed greater activation were more
likely to have worse depression 18
months later. Such imaging techniques
may help identify individuals at risk
for relapse.
Identifying the underlying bio-
logical features of depression will help
in the development of personalized
therapy. Currently, approved antide-
pressant medications raise the levels
of norepinephrine, serotonin, and do-
pamine in nerve cell synapses. Among
the most widely used medications are
SSRIs, which block serotonin re-
uptake and are also used to treat other
psychiatric conditions. These mole-
cules work by reshaping synapses, and
usually require a few weeks to take
effect. Cognitive behavioral therapy,
often in combination with medica-
tions, is also effective in people with
depression. This type of counseling
works to change thought patterns and
reroute negative, dysfunctional think-
ing. Treating people with depression
can be challenging, as medications
affect individuals differently. Some-
times, two or three tries are needed to
find an effective treatment plan.
Unfortunately, for some people
with depression, neither medication
nor psychotherapy works. Research-
ers are actively investigating other
approaches to treating depression,
such as deep brain stimulation (DBS).
Some promising studies have found
that DBS can relieve intense depressive
episodes that were resistant to other
forms of treatment.



Bipolar Disorder
Like most people, you probably
have good days and bad days, days
when everything goes well and days
when the whole world seems against
you. But people with bipolar disorder
(formerly called manic-depressive
illness) experience very intense mood
changes. Their moods swing between
extreme highs and severe lows, each
lasting anywhere from a few hours
to several months. High, or manic,
episodes involve boundless energy,
racing thoughts, and insomnia; they
may also involve substance abuse
and harmful behaviors like risky sex
or other unsafe activities. During
low, or depressive, episodes, people
with bipolar disorder feel very sad
and hopeless, worried, and some-
times suicidal. Some individuals with
bipolar disorder are hypomanic; they
are highly productive, feel great, and
function better than normal. These
changes may be outwardly subtle —
only noticed by a friend or family
member — but can be a clue to more
intense developing mania.
Bipolar disorder is difficult to di-
agnose. No specific tests, other than a
set of symptoms medical professionals
use, differentiate it from other psy-
chiatric disorders such as depression,
psychosis, or schizophrenia. Research-
ers don’t understand what causes
bipolar disorder, although many
individuals have a family history of
a mood disorder or psychotic illness.
Some people with depression may
be at higher risk for bipolar disorder
if a relative is bipolar or has another
psychiatric illness like schizophre-
nia or autism. Studies analyzing the
genomes of thousands of people with
diseases like bipolar disorder have
identified genetic changes that appear
to be involved, but more research is

needed to understand how and why
these DNA misspellings cause serious
brain dysfunction.
Bipolar disorder is notoriously
hard to treat. Psychiatrists typically
prescribe separate drugs to lessen the
highs and stabilize the lows. Medi-
cations such as anti-epilepsy drugs,
lithium, or so-called atypical antipsy-
chotics are used for manic periods,
and antidepressants or cognitive
behavioral therapy during depressed
periods. Most treatments have signif-
icant side effects and, unfortunately,
up to one-third of people with bipolar
disorder do not respond to treatment
at all, creating enormous hardship for
the affected individuals as well as their
family and friends.

**DISORDERS OF COGNITION
Schizophrenia**
Schizophrenia is a lifelong,
severe psychiatric disorder that seri-
ously disturbs thinking, emotion, and


behavior. People with schizophrenia
appear to have lost touch with reality.
They experience “positive” symptoms
such as hallucinations, delusions, and
confused thinking, and “negative”
ones, including an inability to expe-
rience pleasure and a severe lack of
motivation. Like many psychiatric
disorders that first emerge when the
human brain matures in the late teens
and early 20s, schizophrenia usually
appears between ages 15 and 25. This
time period corresponds to develop-
ment of the brain’s prefrontal cortex.
Although no cure exists for schizo-
phrenia and many symptoms do not
respond to treatment, some people
can pursue personal and professional
life goals with the help of medications,
behavioral therapy, or a combination
of these. Chlorpromazine, the first
antipsychotic drug, was developed in
the 1950s as an anesthetic for surgery
but was soon employed to calm people
with psychiatric disorders including



schizophrenia. Since then, more than
20 similar antipsychotic drugs have
been developed. Most of these drugs
work by damping the dopamine
response, which is thought to drive
schizophrenia’s “positive” symptoms.
For that reason, these medications may
cause tremors and other movement-re-
lated side effects resembling Parkinson’s
disease, which involves low dopamine
activity. The most recently developed
drugs also suppress some serotonergic
activity, which seems to help with the
negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Scientists have known for many
years, through studying twins and ex-
tended families in which schizophre-
nia is common, that this condition is
highly influenced by heredity. Only
recently, however, with the emergence
of powerful tools that scan massive
amounts of DNA information, have
scientists identified more than 100
common genetic misspellings and at
least 11 rare ones in the DNA of people
with schizophrenia. Current research is
focused on learning more about these
genes, which affect nerve cell growth
as well as development, learning, and
memory. Genes having a proven rela-
tionship to schizophrenia are potential
targets for new medications.
Recently, research has uncovered a
new and unusual perspective for think-
ing about schizophrenia therapies. Pre-
vious studies had noted that nearly 90
percent of people with schizophrenia
smoke cigarettes, possibly to provide
relief for their symptoms. Research-
ers have learned that nicotine seems
to relax rigid nerve-cell shape and
function in areas of the brain affected
by schizophrenia. Thus, drugs contain-
ing nicotine may prove to be useful as
future treatments for schizophrenia.


Brain imaging can reveal how the brains of individuals with schizophrenia function differently.
In this image, the areas shown in orange were found to be less active in people with schizo-
phrenia compared to healthy controls.

rug abuse has been much
in the news recently, with
particular focus on the over-
prescription and subsequent abuse
of opioids. All too often, this abuse
results in overdose and even death. In
a 6-day period in late August 2017,
one city (Cincinnati, Ohio) reported
that 174 overdose cases flooded their
hospital emergency rooms. The city
is suing the pharmaceutical indus-
try, as are counties in West Virginia,
California, and New York. Addiction
afflicts people around the world, of-
ten with chilling consequences. The
National Institute on Drug Abuse
estimates that the United States
spends $700 billion each year on ad-
diction-associated treatments, crimes,
and lost productivity.
Addiction is a chronic brain disor-
der that affects the body through phys-
ical and psychological dependence.
Intentional, regular use of substances
like opioids, alcohol, tobacco, or other
drugs becomes an addiction when a
person can no longer control his or
her use despite negative consequenc-
es such as loss of control and harm
to themselves or others. One factor
fueling addiction is tolerance — when
a person’s body becomes “used to” a
drug and requires more of it to expe-
rience the same effect. Another facet
of addiction is withdrawal, when lack
of a drug causes the body to react with
unpleasant or life-threatening physi-
cal symptoms. These may range from
moderate headaches or muscle pain to
severe tremors or seizures.
A combination of positive factors
(pleasurable feelings) and negative ones
(avoiding withdrawal) helps to create
an addiction. Cues or triggers, such as
being in a place associated with drug
or alcohol intake or being around oth-
er drug or alcohol users, also provoke

**13 Addiction**

drug-taking behavior. It is important
to realize, though, that drug use does
not always lead to addiction. Addic-
tion is complex, and many researchers
are working to understand the various
interacting influences.
Almost all abused drugs produce
pleasure by activating a specific circuit
of neurons, the brain’s reward sys-
tem, which is controlled mainly by
the neurotransmitter dopamine. This
brain region, called the limbic system,
drives healthy behaviors such as eating
and socializing, but it is also activated
by drugs of abuse. The limbic system
helps people experience emotion,
which somewhat explains the mood-
altering properties of many drugs. In
addition, the brain’s reward system
generates habits and learned behaviors:
When a reward (a delicious food or a
high-inducing drug) generates feelings
of pleasure, we learn to repeat the
actions that led to that reward.

**Mimics and Imposters**
Drugs of abuse act as
imposters that invade
our nervous system, mimicking the
messages of naturally occurring
neurotransmitters in our brain circuits.
While some drugs copy the actions of
neurotransmitters, others can block
neurotransmitter action, and still
others alter the way neurotransmitters
are released or inactivated. Ultimately,
in all cases of addiction, drug use
changes the brain’s reward system and
other regions involved in judgment
and decision-making, contributing to
addictive symptoms and behaviors.
Who is susceptible to becoming
addicted? A precise answer to this
question is still elusive, but we now
know a great deal about vulnerabil-
ity. As with most health conditions,
vulnerability to addiction involves


internal risk factors, such as certain
genes, and external risk factors, such
as stress and a person’s social envi-
ronment. Often, a person’s social
environment both contributes to
addictive behavior and is shaped by



addictive behavior, creating a cycle
that is difficult to break.
Studies that track twins, and other
closely related individuals with and
without addictions, conclude that
about 50 percent of addiction can
be traced to genetic factors. Much
remains to be learned about addiction’s
causes, but researchers are intrigued to
find common genetic links in many
different types of addictions — those
involving a host of illicit drugs, mari-
juana, and legal drugs such as alcohol,
tobacco, and even caffeine. Generally,
the genes linked to addiction fall into
one of two categories. Some of these
genes affect how brain circuits respond
to drugs; others influence the way the
body metabolizes drugs, which then
affects how quickly drugs enter and
leave the body. Other biological factors
important in addiction are gender
and age: Females and males differ in
their risk of addiction as well as their
response to treatment. Also, while



social environment has a significant
influence on drug-taking behavior
during childhood and adolescence, the
influence of hereditary factors is stron-
ger in later stages of addiction, which
usually occur in adults.


#### OPIOIDS


Dating back to prehistoric times,
humans have consumed opioids by
extracting opium (also known as
morphine) from the juice of poppy
flowers. The drug heroin is an opioid
that is made (illegally) by drying
morphine, adding various chemicals,
and then heating it until it evapo-
rates and becomes a powder. When
injected into a vein, heroin reaches
the brain in 15 to 20 seconds. Once
there, it is quickly converted back
to morphine, which binds to opioid
receptors, switching on the brain’s
reward system and flooding synapses
with pleasure-inducing dopamine.
The result is a brief rush of intense
euphoria, followed by a few hours in
a state of relaxed contentment.
Opioids’ effects vary in strength,
toxicity, safety, and how quickly
they act. But why do our brains have
opioid receptors? Our pituitary gland
produces natural versions of opioids

**Addiction 13**

called endorphins, which help control
motivation, emotion, food intake,
and our response to pain. Laborato-
ries produce synthetic opioids, which
include heroin as well as prescription
pain medicines like codeine, oxyco-
done (oxycontin), and fentanyl. Much
more powerful than other opioids,
fentanyl is used by doctors to treat
severe pain. However, illegally made
and distributed versions are sold on
the black market and can be extreme-
ly dangerous. Opioids have many
medically important uses — suppress-
ing a cough, stopping diarrhea, and
relieving pain — but, in excess, they
can cause breathing to stop, the usual
cause of death in an overdose.
Over the past two decades, the
number of overdose deaths involving
opioids (both prescription opioids
and heroin) has quadrupled. Near-
ly 100 Americans, from every walk
of life, die from opioid overdoses
each day. As mentioned above, this
opioid-addiction epidemic appears
to stem directly from increased use
of legally prescribed opioid medica-
tions that began in the mid-1980s to
treat chronic pain. In fact, about 80
percent of current heroin users say
their opioid use began with prescrip-
tion pain medications; once hooked,
they found heroin to be cheaper and
easier to get than the prescription
medications. Tragically, street heroin
can be mixed with other dangerous
substances, including high concentra-
tions of fentanyl that can be imme-
diately fatal. Another contributor to
this epidemic was the 1995 intro-
duction of a long-lasting version of
oxycontin. Researchers now believe
that, in medical as well as nonmedi-
cal users, addiction rather than abuse
is the main driver of the opioid-over-
dose epidemic.


Treatment
The most effective treatment
for opioid overdose is an
antidote-like approach using synthet-
ic drugs that block opioid receptors.
The “antidote,” naloxone, binds to
opioid receptors — without produc-
ing a biological effect — and pre-
vents an opioid from binding. If
given quickly enough, it can actually
reverse a potential overdose caused
by heroin or prescribed painkillers.
Naloxone can also be used in preven-
tion, to limit cravings in people
highly motivated to quit. Doctors
sometimes prescribe naloxone to a
family member of someone at risk of
opioid overdose so they can adminis-
ter it, and many first responders
across the country are taught how to
administer naloxone in cases of
overdose emergencies.
Drug-based treatment for
overdoses can save lives, but other
strategies are needed to treat opioid
addiction itself and prevent future
crises with these highly addictive
substances. Two other drugs, meth-
adone and buprenorphine, stimu-
late opioid receptors, but produce
a limited high. They also reduce
withdrawal symptoms from other
opioids; both drugs have milder
withdrawal symptoms of their own.
Researchers have found that these
therapies can help deter a person
from seeking heroin or other abused
opioids. Of the two, buprenor-
phine is safer because its effect is
weaker than methadone, and it can
be prescribed in an office setting.
Psychosocial approaches, including
cognitive behavioral therapy and be-
havioral change focused on positive
reinforcement, can also be combined
with drug treatments to treat
opioid addiction.


#### NICOTINE


Nicotine is the addictive substance
in tobacco. Within 10 seconds of
smoking a cigarette, nicotine arrives
in the brain (as does any other drug
that is smoked). There it attaches to
proteins on nerve cells called nicotin-
ic acetylcholine receptors, triggering
release of many neurotransmitters. It
also releases neurotransmitters outside
the brain like adrenaline, a stimulant
that raises a person’s blood pressure
and quickens their heart rate. In the
brain, it creates a buzz of pleasure and
energy — due to release of dopamine
— followed by a calming sensation
and a rapid boost in attention and
memory. The latter finding has led
to ongoing tests of non-addictive
nicotine-like substances as possible
treatments for cognitive disorders such
as schizophrenia, attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and
Alzheimer’s disease.
Tobacco is the leading cause of
preventable deaths in the United States,
accounting for approximately 90 per-
cent of lung-cancer deaths, 60 percent
of lung-disease deaths, and 30 percent
of deaths from heart disease. Despite
the well-known health risks of tobac-
co use, however, about 20 percent of
Americans still smoke. Nicotine itself
does not cause cancer, but of the thou-
sands of chemicals in tobacco, about
70 are known to be carcinogenic. How-
ever, nicotine is responsible for other
health risks of smoking, including heart
disease and stroke. Like many other
addictive substances, nicotine generates
tolerance; over time, more and more
nicotine is required to obtain the same
effect. Also like other drugs of abuse,
nicotine activates dopamine-producing
reward pathways that induce feelings of
pleasure and affect motivation, creating
the urge to use more.


### 84 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**13 Addiction**

**Treatment**
Nicotine is so highly addictive
that, even though most
smokers want to quit, few succeed. For
some smokers who are highly motivat-
ed to quit, some drug treatments
(pharmacotherapy) can help. Nicotine
packaged into gum, skin patches,
lozenges, nasal sprays, or inhalers can
sidestep the use of cigarettes or
chewing tobacco. Nicotine replace-
ment products provide users with
lower overall nicotine levels than they
get with tobacco use, totally eliminate
exposure to smoke and its deadly
contents, and relieve withdrawal
symptoms. Buprenorphine, used to
treat opioid addiction, can also help
smokers quit by simulating nicotine’s
effect on dopamine.
One of the newest treatments
for nicotine addiction is varenicline,
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 2006 for to-
bacco-cessation treatments. Varenicline
is a nicotine mimic that attaches to a
special type of nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor — one that is thought to be
responsible for conveying nicotine’s
addictive properties. Doctors consider
varenicline the best single-drug option
for nicotine addiction, and it is even
more effective when combined with
counseling and behavioral therapy.
For example, smokers are twice as
likely to quit if the advice comes from
their medical provider. Other useful
resources are motivational tools such as
cessation hotlines, websites, and social
media that promote tobacco-free living.

**ALCOHOL**
Alcohol, although legal like tobac-
co, is also addictive. Together, alcohol
abuse and alcohol addiction are a se-
rious and costly national health issue.
Aside from secondary behavioral


impacts such as drunken driving,
sexual assault, and domestic violence,
a primary chronic health problem is
associated with alcohol addiction:
cirrhosis, a late-stage of scarring of the
liver. The annual U.S. cost of alcohol
abuse and addiction is estimated at
$250 billion.
Ethanol, the addictive ingredient
in alcoholic drinks, has tricky effects
on our bodies. Ethanol is water-soluble
so it easily enters the bloodstream and
quickly travels to the brain. With just
a drink or two, ethanol acts as a stimu-
lant. At higher blood levels, however, it
acts as a depressant, causing intoxica-
tion, sleepiness, and even “blackouts,”
or short-term memory loss.
Ethanol targets gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors,
which drive the brain’s inhibitory
system. In this capacity, ethanol calms
anxiety, weakens muscles, and delays
reaction time. Ethanol also blocks the
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type
of glutamate receptors, which alter
mood and impair memory, both com-
mon features of intoxication.
Finally, ethanol can stimulate the
brain’s pain-relief circuits, fueled by
natural opioid molecules. This accounts
in part for ethanol’s feel-good effects in
many people. It is also a diuretic — a
substance that pulls water from body
tissues and can cause dehydration.
Binge drinking — excessive alcohol
consumption in a short period of time
— slows heart rate and causes breath-
ing difficulties — usually the underly-
ing cause of death in alcohol overdose.
Chronic, heavy ethanol use can
also change brain structure. People
with alcohol use disorder (former-
ly called alcoholism) can have an
unsteady gait, tremors, and slurred
speech; these symptoms result from
damage to the cerebellum, a brain



region important for movement and
balance. They also suffer from mem-
ory loss due to the degeneration of
neurons in the areas of the brain that
govern learning and memory.
When does alcohol drinking
become alcohol addiction? Federal
surveys have found that nearly 9 in 10
Americans have drunk alcohol at some
point in their lives, and an estimated
15 million have an alcohol use disor-
der, which might develop into addic-
tion. As is true of addictions overall,
about half the risk of alcohol addiction
is thought to be linked to genetics.
Yet, given that not all people who
choose to drink become addicted to
alcohol, it is clear that both genetic and
environmental factors contribute to
alcoholism. Currently, no single factor
or combination of factors can predict
the risk of developing an alcohol use
disorder, although having a parent or
grandparent with an alcohol use disor-
der is a good predictor. For this reason,
neuroscientists often study genetic
and environmental factors separately,
designing some experiments to under-
stand drinking behavior and others to
investigate general issues related to mo-
tivation. Researchers often use animal
models in these types of studies.



Treatments
Most people with a problem
with alcohol use can benefit
from some form of treatment before
their use becomes a dangerous addic-
tion. Treatments include behavioral
therapy such as individual counseling,
group therapy, and support groups.
Some medications (disulfiram,
naltrexone, and acamprosate) are
used to treat alcohol addiction, and
researchers can now use genetic
testing to try to optimize therapy
for individual drinkers.

#### MARIJUANA

Also known as weed or pot,
marijuana comes from the dried
leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds of the
_Cannabis_ plant. The plant contains
the mind-altering chemical tetra-
hydrocannabinol, or THC, which
distorts perception and alters a person’s
sense of time, space, and self. With-
in minutes of smoking a marijuana
“joint,” THC travels from the lungs
to the blood and then into the brain.
Eating foods containing THC can also
create a high, usually within an hour
of ingestion. Although the federal gov-
ernment deems marijuana illegal, in
recent years several states have passed
laws legalizing it. This has substantially


increased documented recreational use
of marijuana in the United States.
Marijuana is not harmless. Neuro-
scientists have discovered that regular
marijuana use is linked to abnormal
neurobiology in brain regions related
to reward, cravings, and thought con-
trol — all are key players in addiction.
Marijuana use during the teen years
can have long-lasting effects on think-
ing, memory, and learning. Although
cannabis-use disorders have been less
studied than other addictions, some
known harms include higher stress lev-
els due to craving and withdrawal, in-
ability to think clearly, missing school
or work, and risky behaviors while
intoxicated. As with other addictions,



heavy marijuana use seems to increase
vulnerability to drug use in susceptible
people, through physical changes in
the brain circuits of reward systems. In
some users, long-term marijuana use
has been linked to schizophrenia.
Our brains make a natural form of
THC called anandamide, which acts
through cannabinoid receptors in the
body that help coordinate movement.
This may explain why people’s driving
is impaired after smoking marijuana.
The hippocampus, involved in mem-
ory and learning, also contains many
THC receptors, possibly explaining
the effects of marijuana on short-term
memory. While relatively little research
has been conducted on the role and
usefulness of marijuana in treating
medical conditions, some studies sug-
gest that another active compound in
marijuana called cannabidiol, or CBD,
which does not produce a high, can
control epileptic seizures, relieve pain
and inflammation, and possibly even
treat mental illness and addictions.
Many people with post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) self-medicate
with marijuana to cope with anxi-
ety, stress, and insomnia, and a few
research studies appear to validate
this strategy. These studies show that
marijuana might reduce anxiety, im-
prove sleep, and erase trauma-related
memories in people with PTSD, but
it is unknown whether this is due to
CBD, THC, or some other ingredient.
More research is needed to explore
these findings. Similarly, marijuana
has been widely regarded as a treat-
ment for reducing nausea associated
with chemotherapy. However, 2017
information from the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) says there is currently
too little evidence to recommend using
cannabis to treat this side effect of
cancer therapy.


Studies show that the brains of drug addicts look different than those of people who don’t
use drugs. This MRI scan reveals a mouse’s thinning cortex, the part of the brain associated
with higher-level functioning, following exposure to cocaine. Researchers found that changes
in brain shape and volume were most pronounced when animals were exposed to cocaine in
adolescence, suggesting the impact drug use has on brain development.

**13 Addiction**

#### PSYCHOSTIMULANTS

Psychostimulants are chemicals
that excite the brain. They give a
temporary boost to physical and/or
mental function, earning some the
nickname “speed.” One very common
psychostimulant is caffeine, and an-
other is nicotine. While both are legal
and commercially available, nicotine
is highly addictive and can create sec-
ondary problems as the main ingre-
dient in cancer-causing cigarettes and
chewing tobacco.
Other psychostimulants are in
commonly prescribed medications that
are sometimes abused recreationally.
For example, doctors prescribe am-
phetamine (Adderall) and methylphe-
nidate (Ritalin or Concerta) to treat
ADHD and the sleeping disorder nar-
colepsy, but these drugs have migrated
to the black market and are widely
sold illegally. Amphetamines, includ-
ing methylphenidate, are frequently
abused by high school and college stu-
dents. One study determined that, by
their senior year, two-thirds of college
students had been offered prescription
stimulants and one-third had used
them non-medically to increase focus
and enhance concentration.
Illegal psychostimulants that are
made in makeshift drug labs and sold
on the street include cocaine and
methamphetamine, or “meth.” Abusers
sometimes smoke these — in particular,
cocaine (crack) and crystal metham-
phetamine (crystal meth) — produc-
ing a rush of euphoria and feelings of
power and self-confidence. Typically,
the effects are short-lived, prompting
repeated use and physical harm to var-
ious organs, including the heart. Meth,
in particular, is quite destructive to the
brain itself, as it generates harmful sub-
stances called free radicals that destroy
dopamine neurons.


In the brain, psychostimulants
work by flooding the brain’s reward
system with dopamine, the “usual
suspect” in most addictions and many
psychiatric disorders. Most psycho-
stimulants act and wear off quickly,
leading to a quick high and then an
unpleasant “crash” that encourages
more use and can be overwhelming,
both physically and mentally. Meth is
especially addictive, entering the brain
very quickly and staying there longer
than other psychostimulants. People
who continue using psychostimulants
develop a tolerance, needing more and
more to get high. Over time, these
drugs damage the body’s ability to
release normal amounts of dopamine,
causing a range of health problems,
starting with a lack of drive to engage
in activities that were once pleasurable.
Neuroscientists are working hard
to figure out how to prevent and treat
addiction to psychostimulants. In the
course of their work, they have learned
a great deal about the brain’s normal
function in motivated behavior. For
example, in addition to increasing do-
pamine in the reward system, psycho-



stimulants act in the prefrontal cortex
to promote arousal and quicken our
thinking. Studies show that low doses
of psychostimulants (much less than
taken in drug abuse) actually improve
the brain’s executive function (as in
some ADHD treatments), helping
with impulse and emotional control,
planning and organizing, and pro-
ductivity. Such low doses do not lead
to tolerance and addiction, but high
doses can impair brain function.



Treatments
Currently the best treatments
for psychostimulant addiction
are cognitive-behavioral therapy and
motivational incentives, both of which
help steer users away from situations
that trigger drug use. So far, no
effective drugs have been approved for
cocaine or meth addiction. However,
now that scientists better understand
how psychostimulants work in the
brain, they are pursuing treatment
strategies that target many neurotrans-
mitters separately to quell cravings and
withdrawal symptoms. The neurotrans-
mitter systems include serotonin,



Methamphetamine abuse can reduce the number of dopamine receptors in the brain,
disrupting mental functions.

glutamate, and GABA. Still-experimen-
tal meth treatments focus on entirely
new targets, such as the brain’s immune
cells (microglia) and oxytocin — the
latter is sometimes called the “love” or
“happiness” hormone because men and
women release it during orgasm and
mothers secrete it during childbirth
and breastfeeding.

**DESIGNER DRUGS
AND CLUB DRUGS**
Designer drugs such as “bath salts”
and “spice” (synthetic marijuana) are
synthetic legal substances with psy-
choactive effects. They look like illicit
drugs but can often be bought legally
because the people who make them
continually tweak their chemical struc-
tures to evade drug laws. We now know
that these drugs can cause serious, per-
manent damage in many brain regions.
Like designer drugs, club drugs are also
synthetic psychoactive substances that
look like legal drugs and are named for
their use by youth at dance parties and
all-night raves in crowded, high-energy


surroundings. Examples of club drugs
include 3,4-methylenedioxy-metham-
phetamine (also known as MDMA,
Ecstasy, or Molly), rohypnol (“roofies”),
GHB (gamma hydroxy-butyrate), and
ketamine. Designer and club drugs can
be stimulants — such as Ecstasy — or
depressants like rohypnol, GHB,
and ketamine.
Ecstasy is a widely used recreational
drug with similarities to both the stimu-
lant amphetamine and the hallucinogen
mescaline, which occurs naturally in
the peyote cactus and has effects similar
to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).
When swallowed, Ecstasy works within
30 to 45 minutes, and its effects last for
several hours. It initially boosts levels of
neurotransmitters, especially serotonin,
then temporarily depletes their levels in
the synapses. Chronic Ecstasy use leads
to long-term changes in areas of the
brain critical for thought, memory, and
pleasure. Researchers think this harm is
a result of long-term damage
to serotonin circuits.
Rohypnol and GHB are both de-



pressants, and mimic benzodiazepines
like Valium. They are also known as
“date-rape” drugs, as people have used
them to facilitate sexual assault by
slipping pills into drinks, sedating and
incapacitating unsuspecting victims.
Ketamine, called “Special K,” is also
a depressant that is legally used as
a veterinary anesthetic. When used
recreationally, ketamine takes effect
within about 10 minutes, putting
users in a trance-like state. Its halluci-
nogenic effects last one or two hours.
Recently, scientists have found a totally
unexpected use for ketamine: treating
depression. Ketamine alters signaling
of the neurotransmitter glutamate, a
non-traditional target for antidepres-
sant medications. Perhaps most inter-
esting are its very rapid effects, which
occur within minutes to hours instead
of the weeks required for other current
antidepressant treatments. For this rea-
son, neuroscientists consider ketamine
a potential breakthrough, especially in
people for whom no other treatments
have been effective.


**H**


umankind has always sought
ways to treat illness, injury,
and pain. For example, the
first known brain surgeries occurred
about 6,000 years ago in Asia Minor.
Also, archaeologists have found skulls
of ancient Incas of Peru with small
pieces of skull carefully removed (a
process called trepanation) to treat
head wounds, or possibly to cure
epilepsy or infections. The earliest of
these Incan skulls did not show any
healing, indicating that the patients
soon died. But by the 1400s, about 90
percent of the ancient skulls discovered
showed bone regrowth.
How did those patients survive
and how did they deal with the pain?
It is likely that herbs like tobacco and
coca leaves, and corn beer might have
been consumed to provide some relief.
As you learn about brain tumors, head
trauma, pain management, and other
problems caused by disease processes,
remember that neuroscience seeks to
understand the roots of these issues.
Such insights will ultimately advance
the medical field, enabling more effec-
tive treatments and therapies for the
future.



BRAIN TUMORS
Each year, more than 79,000 peo-
ple in the United States are likely to be
diagnosed with a tumor that originates
in their brain — a primary brain
tumor. An estimated 26,000 of these
tumors will be malignant (cancerous),
and 53,000 will be benign (noncancer-
ous). In addition, more than 200,000
people will be diagnosed with brain
tumors that develop when cancer cells
from other parts of the body travel
through the bloodstream to the brain.
Called metastatic brain tumors, these
cancers typically spread from tumors of
the lung, breast, skin, colon, or kidney.

### 89

Regardless of its origin, a tumor, or
any space-occupying lesion in the
brain, can be lethal — thus surgical
removal is required for survival.
Types of brain tumors are named
according to the kind of cell from
which they arise and the brain area
where they develop. For example,
many brain tumors are called glio-
mas — a general term for tumors that
arise from the glial cells that support
and protect neurons in the brain. The
most common form of brain _cancer_
is a glioblastoma — a proliferation of
immature glial cells. The most com-
mon type of primary brain _tumor_ is a
meningioma: a benign tumor arising
in the meninges, thin layers of tissue
that cover the brain.
Symptoms of a brain tumor vary
with its location and size and also
differ among people. In some cases, a
tumor causes general symptoms such
as headache, due mainly to the pres-
sure a tumor exerts on the brain. Or,
a tumor located in a part of the brain
controlling vision can cause difficulties
with sight. In other cases, a tumor can
damage healthy tissue as it grows. For
example, as gliomas grow, they release
toxic amounts of glutamate, which can
destroy nerve cells near the tumor and
cause seizures.
Several treatments — including
surgery, radiation, targeted treatments,
and chemotherapy — can be used
alone or in combination to treat brain
tumors. The goal of the treatments is
to remove or shrink brain tumors to
relieve pressure on the brain, as well
as eliminating or reducing symptoms
such as seizures and headaches.
If a tumor can be accessed with-
out injuring nearby areas of the brain,
surgery is usually the first step. Brain
tumors can be removed with conven-
tional techniques such as a craniotomy,


in which the skull is opened and as
much tumor as possible is removed.
Another type of treatment for some tu-
mors uses radiation. For this technique,
called stereotactic radiosurgery, a high
dose of radiation is aimed precisely at
the tumor. A few radiation treatments
can reduce or eliminate the tumor
while sparing healthy tissue nearby.
More recently, tumors are treated by
multiple beams of ultrasound focused
precisely to intersect exactly at the
site of the tumor. These interventions
can be carried out painlessly in awake
patients inside imaging machines that
visualize the tumor in the brain.
Following conventional surgery,
doctors usually prescribe steroid
medications to reduce swelling in the
brain. Reduced swelling helps alleviate
symptoms such as seizures, memory
problems, or confusion that can occur
after brain surgery. In patients with



cancerous brain tumors, radiation may
be administered to surrounding brain
areas to help eliminate any cancer
cells that remain in the brain after
surgery. People with cancerous brain
tumors can also be given chemother-
apy to prevent growth or regrowth
of their tumors. In the past decade,
researchers have developed new ways
to administer chemotherapy that allow
medication to be delivered directly to
the brain (tumor), rather than travel-
ing through the body before reaching
the brain. For example, after surgical
removal of a brain tumor, small wafers
containing anticancer drugs can be
implanted in the space previously
occupied by the tumor. Over time, the
wafers slowly dissolve and release the
chemotherapy drugs to nearby areas.
Researchers have also been study-
ing various promising treatments that
target specific cell mechanisms thought

to be important to cancer cell growth.
These targeted treatments zero in on
genes and other cell mechanisms that
fuel cancer cell growth, while sparing
healthy tissues and causing less severe
side effects than those that occur with
conventional radiation or chemother-
apy. For example, medications that
help block formation of blood vessels
are already being used to treat glioblas-
tomas. Blocking tumor blood vessel
formation is a key strategy in treating
glioblastomas, because these tumors
form strong networks of vessels that
feed tumor growth.
Researchers are also testing ways to
stimulate the ability of the body’s own
immune system to stop tumor growth
— an approach called immunother-
apy. For example, promising research
is using substances called checkpoint
inhibitors, which interfere with the
signals some tumors send to inhibit
the immune system’s ability to block
tumor growth.
Another promising area of research
involves gene therapy. This technolo-
gy identifies the genetic components
that promote tumor growth and then
interferes with their ability to work. Re-
search is currently underway on a num-
ber of different gene therapies aimed
at killing tumor cells and suppressing
their growth-promoting genes.
Other approaches also under
development focus on targeted delivery
of antibodies, toxins, and growth-
inhibiting molecules that can attach
specifically to tumor cells and interfere
with their growth. Researchers are
also exploring the role of stem cells in
both the development and treatment
of brain tumors. Stem cells are undif-
ferentiated, or unspecialized, cells with
the potential to develop into any of
a number of specialized cells, such as
neurons. Normally, regulatory processes


prevent mature, specialized cells from
dividing and spreading; cancer cells es-
cape these regulations. Understanding
the normal processes that allow stem
cells to mature will allow researchers to
understand what might be going awry
in cancer cells.



NEUROLOGICAL TRAUMA
Traumatic brain and spinal cord
injuries can lead to significant disabili-
ties and death. In the United States, an
estimated 1.7 million people sustain
traumatic brain injuries (TBI) each



year. Of those, 275,000 are hospi-
talized, and about 52,000 will die as
a result of TBI. Falls are the leading
cause of all traumatic brain injury, and
motor vehicle/traffic injury is the lead-
ing cause of TBI-related death. The
direct medical costs and indirect costs
of TBI, such as lost productivity, are
estimated to be more than $60 billion
a year in the United States.
Each year, about 17,000 people
suffer spinal cord injuries in the Unit-
ed States, and an estimated 282,000
people currently live with spinal
cord injuries. Vehicle crashes are the
leading cause of spinal cord injury,
followed by falls, acts of violence



(primarily gunshot wounds), and
injuries due to participation in sports
and recreational activities. Death
rates among people with spinal cord
injuries are significantly higher during
the first year after the injury, especial-
ly people whose injuries cause severe
neurological impairments.
Few effective remedies have been
found to repair damage incurred by
head and spinal cord injuries; however,
new methods have come to light for
preventing damage that develops after
the initial injury. In addition, there are



ongoing efforts to support better reha-
bilitation techniques as well as research
into the regeneration and repair of
injured tissue.



Traumatic Brain Injury
Widespread use of computer-
ized tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
has afforded opportunities to observe
the extent of tissue damage in TBI and
determine its medical management.
Traumatic brain injuries are caused
by bumps, blows, or jolts to the head
that cause multiple minuscule bleeds
or by penetrating head injuries that
directly destroy brain tissue. TBI can

be going awry in cancer cells.

be “mild,” such as concussion — a
temporary disruption in brain activity
— or “severe.” TBI can cause bruises
in the brain, massive bleeding inside
the brain, cuts in the brain tissue, di-
rect nerve damage, and death of nerve
cells. Brain injury can trigger swelling,
fever, seizures, and other neurological
impairments. Even mild TBI can cause
damage to neurons, which release
pro-inflammatory factors that initiate
and sustain an inflammatory response.
People such as professional foot-
ball players or boxers, who sustain
repeated concussions and other brain
trauma, might develop a progres-
sive degenerative brain disease called
chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE). CTE occurs when repeated
head trauma triggers degeneration of
brain tissue; this process includes a
buildup of abnormal proteins, which
can begin months, years, or even
decades after the last brain trauma.
Symptoms associated with CTE
include memory loss, confusion,
impaired judgment, impulse control
problems, aggression, depression, and,
eventually, progressive dementia.
Most people with mild brain inju-
ries, such as concussions, recover fully
in a short period of time. Yet a study
of college ice hockey players who had
concussions showed that their brain
volume had decreased two weeks after
the concussion, a change that lasted at
least two months. Rest and avoidance
of physically demanding activities
give the brain time to heal and are key
aspects of recovery. People who arrive in
the emergency department with a severe
head injury are carefully monitored for
bleeding or swelling that puts pressure
on the brain. Treatments for increased
pressure inside the skull include re-
moving an amount of water fluid from
injured and inflamed brain tissue.


Severe TBIs can cause bruising on
the surface or within the brain. The
bruising might cause blood to leak
from vessels and contact brain tissue
directly, which can be toxic to brain
cells. Pressure often increases in the
injured area, compresses the blood
vessels, and reduces critical blood flow
to the injured tissues. If fluid removal
and medications fail to decrease pres-
sure on the brain, part of the skull can
be drilled open or removed to relieve
pressure on the brain. In extreme
cases of TBI, bruising in the brain can
contribute to development of a seizure
disorder called post-traumatic epilepsy.
Once a person with a brain injury
is stable, the long road to recovery be-
gins. Physical and occupational therapy
are used to help people regain lost func-
tions such as speech and movement. A
wide variety of medications can be used
to treat other symptoms of TBI such
as pain, seizures, muscle spasms, sleep
disorders, depression, and anxiety.



Spinal Cord Injury
Like TBI, spinal cord injuries
(SCI) can permanently
damage nerve cells and cause a wide
range of disabilities — including
various degrees of paralysis. Methyl-
prednisolone, a steroid drug, is the
only treatment for SCI currently
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). This medica-
tion appears to reduce damage to nerve
cells and decrease inflammation near
the site of the SCI. If administered
within eight hours of injury, it can be
effective in treating spinal cord injuries
in some people.
There is no cure for spinal cord
injuries, but scientists are investigating
new ways to repair damaged spinal
cords. These include protecting surviv-
ing nerve cells from further damage,



replacing damaged nerve cells, stimulat-
ing the regrowth of axons and targeting
their connections, and retraining nerve
circuits to restore bodily functions. In
addition, scientists constantly search
for new methods for rehabilitating
patients with SCI and improving their
quality of life. Rehabilitation focuses on
physical therapy to strengthen muscles
and improve mobility. Occupational
therapy focuses on enhancing fine
motor skills, such as the skills needed to
write or type. Electrical stimulation is
sometimes used to help restore function
to muscles affected by the injury.
Scientists have also discovered that
new nerve cells can be born in an adult
brain. However, these new cells do not
seem to help an injured brain repair
itself, so studies are ongoing to deter-
mine how to jumpstart the pathway
that stimulates the birth of new nerve
cells. Stem cells, some even derived
from a patient’s own tissues, might
be able to start a new population of
cells that are able to produce many
cell types, nerve cells among them.
Researchers are also working to under-
stand how certain neurochemical and
cellular barriers that prevent regrowth
and repair can be overcome and how
the newly born cells can be induced to
integrate into the injured circuit.



NEUROLOGICAL
ACQUIRED IMMUNE
DEFICIENCE SYNDROME
In 2015, about 2.1 million people
worldwide became infected with
the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Currently, an estimated 37 million
people worldwide live with HIV.
The vast majority live in eastern and
southern Africa, and about 40 percent
of people living with HIV are unaware


### Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**14 Injury & Illness**

### 92

that they are infected with the virus.
From 2008 to 2014, the estimated
number of new HIV diagnoses in the
U.S. fell by 18 percent, possibly due to
targeted prevention efforts.
Globally, the number of people re-
ceiving treatment for HIV has increased
dramatically in recent years, particularly
in developing countries. In 2015, 17
million people living with HIV were
receiving life-prolonging antiretroviral
treatment. In 2010, only 7.5 million
people were receiving this treatment.
Although HIV targets the immune
system, the nervous system can also be
affected. More than half of people with
HIV develop HIV-associated neuro-
cognitive disorders (HAND). HAND
causes mental problems ranging from
mild difficulty with concentration,
memory, coordination, and complex
decision-making to progressive demen-
tia, called AIDS dementia. Even people
who receive antiretroviral treatments
can develop mild symptoms of HAND.
The mechanism behind the
development of HAND is unclear.
Most scientists speculate that certain
proteins in the virus itself, or proteins
released by cells infected with HIV,
cause nerve damage leading to the
disorder. Whatever the mechanism,
HIV infection appears to be the key
player in HAND, because antiretrovi-
ral treatment may prevent or reverse it
in many people.
Mild forms of HAND have been
reported in about one-third of people
with HIV infection who have no other
symptoms. In advanced disease, people
can develop increasing problems with
concentration and memory as well
as an overall slowing of their mental
processes. At the same time, they
might experience leg weakness and
loss of balance. MRI and CT scans
show brain shrinkage in people with


HAND. Examination of the brains of
people who die with AIDS sometimes
reveal loss of nerve cells, white matter
abnormalities, and damage to cellular
structures involved in cell-to-cell com-
munication. Inflammation and vessel
disease can also be present.
Recently, research has indicated that
“cocktails” of three or more antiretrovi-
ral (ARV) drugs active against HIV can
reduce the incidence of AIDS dementia.
These treatments can also reverse brain
abnormalities caused by HIV.
Another neurological problem
commonly developed by people with
HIV is peripheral neuropathy. Periph-
eral neuropathy involves injury to the
nerves of the extremities and causes
discomfort ranging from tingling and
burning to severe pain. HIV is believed
to trigger the injury, and certain ARVs
can cause the neuropathies or make
them more frequent and serious. More
than half of people with advanced
AIDS have neuropathy.
Despite remarkable advances in
new therapies, AIDS cannot be cured,
and some of its neurological prob-
lems do not respond to treatment.
In addition, people living with HIV
are particularly vulnerable to certain
infections and cancers because the
virus weakens their immune system.
Fortunately, combination ARVs have
greatly reduced the incidence of most
of these infections, as well as some of
the neurological problems associated
with AIDS.



MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an
inflammatory disease of the
central nervous system, usually
diagnosed in people between 20 and
40 years of age. For unknown reasons,
the immune system of a person with
MS launches an attack against its own



central nervous system, including the
brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The target of this attack is the myelin
sheath, a fatty substance that forms
a protective coating around nerve
fibers; the nerve fibers themselves can
also be affected. As a result of the
attack, the damaged myelin and the
accompanying inflammatory cells
form lesions, patches of scar tissue
that look like sclerosis.
In MS, the patches of disease
activity appear in multiple areas of the
central nervous system, which is why
the disease is called multiple sclerosis.
Damage to the myelin sheaths and
nerve fibers interferes with transmis-
sion of nerve impulses within the
brain and spinal cord, as well as their
communication with other body areas.
The effects of MS are often compared
to the loss of insulation around an
electric wire and damage to the wire
itself, interfering with signal transmis-
sion. Damage can occur in the white
(myelin) and gray (nerve cell bodies,
glia, etc.) matter of the brain.
The cause of MS is unknown,
but there are some hints that a genetic
factor is involved. Siblings of people
with MS are 10 to 15 times more like-
ly to develop MS than people with no
family history of the disease. The risk
is particularly high for an identical
twin of someone with MS. Oddly, the
disease is as much is five times more
prevalent in temperate climates, such
as the northern United States and
northern Europe, than in the tropics.
Although Caucasians run a higher risk
than other races of developing MS,
the prevalence of MS indicates that
risk is shaped by both genetic and
geographical factors.
Damage to the nervous system
in people with MS can cause a wide
array of symptoms. The spinal cord,


### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts

**Injury & Illness 14**

### 93

cerebellum, and optic nerve are com-
monly affected by MS, so problems of-
ten arise in functions controlled by those
areas. Symptoms include numbness,
clumsiness, and blurred vision. Other
symptoms are slurred speech, weakness,
pain, loss of coordination, uncontrol-
lable tremors, loss of bladder control,
memory loss, depression, and fatigue.
When a person is diagnosed with
MS, treatment options depend on
the type of disease that is present.
Specialists classify MS as one of three
categories: relapsing-remitting MS,
characterized by flare-ups of new or
worsening symptoms followed by
complete or partial remission of symp-
toms; primary-progressive MS, defined


by progressive worsening of symptoms
after disease onset; and secondary-pro-
gressive MS, in which relapsing-re-
mitting disease has transitioned into
a progressive form of disease that
worsens over time.
Within each category, MS is
further classified as “active” or “not
active.” While the categories refer
to the progression of symptoms, the
classification refers to presence (“ac-
tive”) or absence (“not active”) of new
areas of inflammation, seen on MRI
scans. In some cases, MS is defined
as “stable,” meaning that symptoms
are stable and no activity appears on
routine MRI scans.
MS has no cure, but an increasing



number of medications are becoming
available or are under investigation.
Since 2010, six new or revised dis-
ease-modifying therapies have been ap-
proved for use in people with MS. In
addition, several medications can now
help control the inflammation and
immune system attacks in relapsing-re-
mitting MS. Steroid drugs, specifically
glucocorticoids, reduce the inflamma-
tion and might also help shorten acute
attacks. Medications and therapies are
also available to control symptoms
such as muscle stiffness, pain, fatigue,
mood swings, and bladder, bowel, or
sexual dysfunction.



CHRONIC PAIN
Pain can be acute — a short-lived
side effect of injury or disease — or
a chronic condition that persists
for weeks, months, or even years.
For some people, pain is the disease
itself. Pain affects more Americans
than diabetes, heart disease, and
cancer combined, afflicting the lives
of approximately 100 million Amer-
icans. Back pain, severe headache or
migraine pain, and facial ache are the
most common culprits. In the US,
the cost of healthcare, disability, and
lost productivity due to pain ranges
from $560 billion to $635 billion
annually. Chronic pain can trigger
a cascade of psychological processes
that lead to changes in perception,
attention, mood, motivation, learn-
ing, and memory. Increasing evidence
indicates the value of a combination of
treatments involving drugs, behavior,
physical therapy, and other modalities
to fully manage chronic pain.



Treating Pain
Anesthesia is used to prevent pain
during a wide variety of medical pro-
cedures and surgery. Local anesthetics


At the location of an injury, the body produces prostaglandins, which increase pain sensitiv-
ity. Aspirin blocks the production of prostaglandins, thus preventing pain. Opiate drugs act
in the brain and spinal cord to block pain signals.

work by temporarily blocking pain
receptors. Commonly used anesthet-
ics include procaine (Novocain)
and lidocaine.
Once pain occurs, four main
types of painkillers may be used to
relieve it: aspirin and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
such as ibuprofen and naproxen;
opioids (powerful drugs that act di-
rectly on the nervous system) such as
morphine and codeine; antiepileptic
agents such as gabapentin; and anti-
depressants such as amitriptyline.
NSAIDs reduce inflammation
and are effective for postoperative
pain and for pain caused by inflam-
mation such as arthritis. NSAIDs
are also useful for treating the mild
or moderate pain of headaches,
sprains, or toothache. NSAIDs work
by inhibiting substances that trigger
the synthesis of pro-inflammatory
and pain-producing chemicals (such
as prostaglandins). Moderate pain is
often treated by combining a mild
opioid like codeine with aspirin or
another NSAID.
Opioids, often used for severe
pain, work directly in the central
nervous system by attaching to recep-
tors on nerve cells. These drugs not
only reduce feelings of pain but also
produce feelings of euphoria. While
highly effective against pain, opioids
do have many serious side effects,
such as slowing a person’s breathing.
Most importantly, they are highly ad-
dictive. The current opioid epidemic
in the United States is caused, in part,
by the facility to obtain opioid pre-
scriptions and poor pain management
of chronic pain. The brain of a person
suffering from chronic pain under-
goes major changes, and the solution
for this complex problem should
include more than pharmaceuticals.


Psychological therapies such as
cognitive behavioral therapy and
biofeedback can also be used to stim-
ulate relaxation and release muscle
tension, thereby helping reduce the
effects of chronic pain. Psychological
treatments can also help people man-
age changes in mood, perception,
memory, and other psychological fac-
tors often affected by chronic pain.
Antiepileptic and antidepres-
sant drugs are generally used to treat
nerve pain that results from injury to



the nervous system. Nerve damage
and pain (neuropathy) can be due to
chronic high blood sugar levels; vi-
ruses, such as shingles; phantom limb
pain; or post-stroke pain.



The Body’s Pain Control System
Studies of the body’s pain control
system have shown that our bodies
produce their own naturally occurring
opioids, called endorphins. Scien-
tists have also identified the recep-
tors through which opioids work to



A stroke occurs when a blood vessel bringing oxygen and nutrients to the brain bursts or is
clogged by a blood clot. Without blood, cells in the brain start to die within minutes. It can
also cause dangerous molecules called free radicals to escape, which can further damage
brain tissue. The effects of a stroke, such as movement or speech problems, depend on
where in the brain the stroke occurs.

decrease pain. The finding that opioid
receptors are concentrated in the spi-
nal cord led to the use of injections of
morphine and other opioids into the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surround-
ing the spinal cord. Remarkably, these
injections enabled profound pain
control without causing paralysis,
numbness, or other severe side effects.
This technique is commonly used to
treat pain after surgery. In addition,
some patients are given implanted
opioid pumps to enable long-term
treatment of severe chronic pain.
Scientists have identified many
molecules that are involved in the
body’s pain response. Developing
drugs that target these molecules
could have great benefit for treating
patients who experience acute or
chronic pain.
Advances in brain imaging
techniques have also broadened our
understanding of how the brain
perpetuates chronic pain after a
painful stimulus has been removed
and injuries have healed. As a result,
pain researchers are moving toward a
whole-brain approach for their stud-
ies, developing new technologies and
techniques that could lead to better
diagnosis and more effective treatment
of chronic pain.

#### STROKE


Each year, nearly 800,000
people in the United States
suffer a stroke — an interruption in
blood flow to the brain due to a
ruptured blood vessel or a blood clot.
Of these, about 600,000 are first
strokes. Strokes are a leading cause of
long-term disability in the United
States, costing about $33 billion each
year, including the costs of health care
services and medicines to treat stroke,
and missed days of work. More than
130,000 Americans die of a stroke
each year.
Risk factors for stroke include
obesity, physical inactivity, and heart
disease. Controlling these factors
by maintaining a healthful weight,
exercising, avoiding excessive alcohol
intake, and taking medications for
stroke-related physical problems such
as high blood pressure, can reduce the
risk of having a stroke. There is also a
genetic component in stroke risk, es-
pecially evident if a parent has suffered
a stroke by age 65. To date, several
candidate genes have been suggested,
but increased stroke risk is most likely
due to multiple genetic factors.
Until recently, treatments for a
stroke did not go far beyond physical
or speech therapy. Today, however,



clot-dissolving medications are a
standard treatment. Tissue plasmino-
gen activator (tPA), a clot-dissolving
drug approved by the FDA in 1996,
helps to break down blood clots and
open blocked blood vessels. tPA can
restore circulation before oxygen loss
causes permanent brain damage; given
within three hours of a stroke, its use
often limits brain damage. In addition,
surgery to clear clogged arteries and
other treatments targeting heart disease
can help prevent strokes. Anticoagu-
lant drugs also help by reducing the
likelihood of clots forming elsewhere
in the body and traveling to the brain,
causing a stroke.
Research is underway to find new
methods for preventing and treating
strokes. Some drugs have been shown
to be effective at preventing damage
to the nervous system, including nerve
cell death following a stroke. Another
promising research area is the use of
neural stem cells to improve recovery
after a stroke. Preliminary research
suggests that injection of stem cells
helps promote recovery, even when
given several days after a stroke.
Administering growth-stimulating
substances along with the stem cells
might enhance the benefits of the
stem cell transplant.

eurodegenerative diseases
all involve a progressive
destruction of nerve cells.
They more often affect older people,
and are likely to become more com-
mon as life expectancy rises due to
improved medical care — not only in
the in the U.S. but worldwide. From
2015 to 2060, the number of people
65 and older in the U.S. is expected
to jump from 48 million (15 per-
cent of the population) to 98 million
(nearly 25 percent of the population).
As scientists look ahead, the field of
neurodegenerative disease promises to
become increasingly important.
In the past two or three years, arti-
cles in Nature , Scientific American , and
other major science publications have
discussed the intriguing possibility that
many, if not all, neurodegenerative dis-
eases involve misfolded proteins called
prions. You may have heard of prions in
the context of “mad cow disease.” Scien-
tists now wonder if prions also contrib-
ute to more familiar disorders such as
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS,
known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). In the
case of prions, a protein’s normal 3-D
structure has somehow been altered,
so that it no longer functions correctly.
Worse still, the misfolding can cause
proteins to collect in irregular clumps
that can damage cells. Is this really the
cause of neurodegenerative diseases?
Many scientists are asking that question.
As you read this chapter, remember that
there’s still a lot to learn in this field —
and each step toward understanding
normal brain function aids the devel-
opment of prevention or treatment for
thousands of people in the future.



ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Alzheimer’s disease is a form
of dementia that is eventually fatal.

**Neurodegenerative Diseases 15**

Over time, a person’s brain undergoes
irreversible, progressive degeneration
that impairs his or her memory and
reasoning. In the late-onset form of
Alzheimer’s, patients display symp-
toms in their mid-60s or later, with
symptoms becoming more severe
with age. In early-onset forms of the
disease, patients can start to experience
symptoms in their 30s. Fortunately,
early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs in less
than 10 percent of cases of the disease.

**Prevalence and Impact**
Alzheimer’s is the most common
cause of dementia in older adults. Of
the 47 million people with dementia
worldwide, approximately 60 to 70
percent have Alzheimer’s. The disease
affects 5 to 8 percent of all people
over 65 years of age, 15 to 20 percent
above 75, and 25 to 50 percent of
those over 85. It’s estimated that more
than 5 million people in the U.S.
suffer from the disease; however, the
actual number could be as high as 11
million, including many who are now
asymptomatic. Conservative estimates
are that Alzheimer’s will affect 13.8
million people in the U.S. by 2050.
In 2014, Alzheimer’s was the sixth
leading cause of death in the U.S.,
accounting for 93,541 deaths. Deaths
rose from 16.5 per 100,000 people in
1999 to 25.4 per 100,000 in 2014,
but Alzheimer’s-related deaths are
believed to be severely underreported.
Some patients go undiagnosed, and
others have dementia-related condi-
tions (such as aspiration pneumonia)
rather than Alzheimer’s listed as their
primary cause of death. Some estimate
that the number of Alzheimer’s-
related deaths might be six to seven
times higher than reported. If this is
accurate, it would be the third leading
cause of death among older Americans.


Symptoms of
Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s symptoms are clas-
sified by the disease’s progression.
Early stage symptoms include mem-
ory problems (greater than expected
in healthy people of a similar age),
difficulty concentrating or finding
appropriate words, problems judging
and calculating, and disorientation
in time or place. Most people are not
diagnosed until the mild stage when
symptoms include personality and
behavior changes, wandering and
getting lost, repeating questions, losing
and placing objects in odd places,
taking longer to complete daily tasks,
and having trouble handling money
and paying bills. In the moderate stage ,
some patients have trouble recogniz-
ing family and friends; inability to



learn new things; problems coping
with new situations; difficulty getting
dressed or performing other multistep
tasks; hallucinations, delusions, and
paranoia; and impulsive behavior. In
the severe stage , patients are completely
dependent on others for care, as their
body begins shutting down. Their
communication is reduced to groans,
moans, and grunts; sleeping increases;
and they become bedridden. Other
severe stage symptoms include weight
loss, seizures, difficulty swallowing,
skin infections, and a lack of bowel
and bladder control.



Diagnosing Alzheimer’s
Alzheimer’s dementia is most
commonly diagnosed by a physi-
cian asking the patient and a family
member or friend about the patient’s



Alzheimer’s disease damages and destroys the connections between cells, causing wide-
spread cell death. The damage causes problems with learning, memory, and thinking, and is
eventually fatal.

health, medical history, ability to
perform daily activities, and changes
in behavior and personality. Next, the
physician conducts tests on memory,
problem-solving, attention, counting,
and language. Even if mental deficits
are found, including dementia, the
condition still might not be Alzhei-
mer’s. Similar deficits could be due to
other conditions including Lewy body
disease, frontotemporal dementia,
Parkinson’s disease, stroke, a tumor,
sleep disturbances, side effects from
medication, or infection.
Researchers are searching for a
defining biomarker for Alzheimer’s
— a specific indicator that can physi-
cally identify a disease. Two candidate
primary biomarkers are amyloid-beta
(also called beta-amyloid) and tau.
In Alzheimer’s, amyloid-beta forms
extracellular senile plaques, also known
as neuritic plaques. These malformed
clumps contain a fragment of the
preliminary protein. In addition,
tau, a type of protein that normally
stabilizes the cellular skeleton, forms
neurofibrillary tangles inside neurons.
Both abnormalities are found in the
brains of people with Alzheimer’s but,
at present, no definitive biomarker can
diagnose the disease in its early stages.
A diagnosis can only be confirmed by
postmortem examination.
Some potential diagnostic meth-
ods for Alzheimer’s include brain
imaging, genetic risk profiling, and
examining cerebrospinal fluid or
blood. Neuroimaging, among the most
promising areas of research focused on
early detection, uses a mildly radio-
active chemical marker that binds
to amyloid plaques and shows their
location in PET scans of living people.
Starting in 2012, the FDA began ap-
proving the use of molecular imaging
tracers to evaluate possible Alzheimer’s


disease or other causes of dementia. To
date, the FDA has approved the use of
three tracers — florbetapir F-18, flute-
metamol F18, and florbetaben F18
— to detect amyloid-beta in the brain.
However, neuritic plaques are also
present in the brains of people with no
dementia or Alzheimer’s, so these scans
are not used for routine evaluation.



Causes and Pathology
The causes and mechanisms
underlying Alzheimer’s disease are not
fully understood. Most forms are likely
caused by a combination of heredity,
environment, and habits. Evidence
has been building that head trauma
is one contributing factor, based on



a condition known as chronic trau-
matic encephalopathy (CTE) seen in
football players and other athletes who
play contact sports. Those with CTE
typically show a buildup of tau protein
in brain cells; some also have amyloid-
beta deposits, but this is less common.
It appears that patients experience
the first cellular changes associated
with Alzheimer’s a decade or more be-
fore becoming symptomatic. The neu-
ronal transport system shows damage
early in Alzheimer’s. Patients produce
fewer neurotransmitters — chemi-
cal molecules that are released from
an axon terminal, travel across gaps
called synapses, and transmit signals to
another neuron, organ, or other tissue



Amyloid plaques, seen here as dark spots against pink brain tissue, are a hallmark of
Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists are still investigating whether plaques cause the disease
or are merely a symptom of it.

type. In Alzheimer’s disease, axons and
synapses are damaged and ultimate-
ly destroyed. Damage to neuronal
transport impairs attention, memory,
learning, and higher cognitive abilities.
While the cause is unknown, neuritic
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are
the two prime suspects. Plaques consist
of amyloid-beta, which is formed from
malformed clumps of a fragment of
amyloid precursor protein (APP), a fi-
brous protein often found at neuronal
synapses. In its soluble form, amy-
loid-beta can bind strongly to neural
receptors, which initiates the erosion
of synapses. Evidence indicates that
this soluble form is highly synaptotox-
ic, while the insoluble form (which has
low toxicity) tends to aggregate, and is
found in much higher concentrations
than the soluble form. Some research
suggests that the highly toxic, soluble
form would be a better target for
effective therapies.
The amyloid hypothesis is cur-
rently the dominant theory of how
beta amyloid and tau protein interact
to cause Alzheimer’s. This hypothe-
sis asserts that amyloid-beta starts a
sequence of events that ultimately lead
to Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid-beta
accumulations first appear in the neo-
cortex. Its neurotoxicity might be due
to the fact that it exacerbates oxidative
stress and damages the mitochondria,
the cell’s primary energy supply unit,
initiating a cascade of neuronal dys-
function and cell death. The formation
of neuritic plaques induces tau pro-
teins to become defective and tangle
into neurotoxic neurofibrillary tangles
(hyperphosphorylated tau protein)
within neuron cell bodies. (In contrast,
normal tau protein stabilizes micro-
tubules, which are crucial to axonal
transport). Neurofibrillary tangles are
generally first seen in the entorhinal


cortex and the hippocampus, regions
responsible for short-term memory
and for transferring those memories to
longer-term memory.
Although amyloid-beta and tau
accumulations are found in people
with Alzheimer’s, there is no definite
proof that they cause Alzheimer’s. We
do have evidence that tau and amy-
loid-beta might interact before clump-
ing into their recognized disease forms.
Even before it aggregates, malfunction-
ing tau can damage cellular transpor-
tation by blocking the microtubule
tracks. Also, high tau levels can impair
the function of amyloid-beta.
It’s possible that inflammation
and the presence of obesity can trigger
these protein changes, increasing
Alzheimer’s incidence and severity.
Plaques and tangles are known to
negatively interact with microglia,
non-neural brain cells that act as
immune cells for the central nervous
system, and astroglia, which offer
physiological regulation and structural
support in the brain.



Genetics of Alzheimer’s
Early-onset Alzheimer’s is a rare,
dominantly inherited form of the
disease. Dominant mutations in three
genes — APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2
— cause early-onset familial Alzhei-
mer’s disease that starts when people
are in their 40s and 50s. In late-onset
Alzheimer’s, the ApoE4 variant of the
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a
major genetic risk factor but not a
determining one. The normal protein,
ApoE, is mainly produced by astroglia
or damaged neurons and helps clear
soluble amyloid-beta from the brain.
In most people, Alzheimer’s results
from a combination of genetic and en-
vironmental causes. Several genetic as-
sociations have been noted. A mutant



C9ORF72 gene has been found in
people with both early- and late-onset
forms of the disease. This gene codes
for a protein that regulates transpor-
tation in the intracellular matrix. The
mutation was already known to play a
major role in ALS and frontotemporal
dementia, but recent studies show that
it also disrupts a key mechanism for
DNA repair.
The TOMM40 gene, which codes
for a protein responsible for moving
proteins into mitochondria, has a
complex relationship with Alzhei-
mer’s. People with a longer version
of the gene were shown to be either
predisposed or resistant to Alzheimer’s
— depending on whether a parent
had the disease. Among those with an
afflicted parent, people with the longer
version of the gene were more apt to
develop dementia than those with the
shorter allele; but among those with no
afflicted parent, people with a longer
allele displayed better memory than
those with a shorter gene allele.
With the TREM2 gene, loss-of-
function mutations cause a sequence
of physiological events associated
with Alzheimer’s disease. This sug-
gests a possible genetic link between
early- and adult-onset variants — the
homozygous loss-of-function mutation
is associated with early-onset and the
heterozygous variant with adult-
onset. Normally, TREM-2 protein
helps regulate removal of cell debris,
clearing amyloid proteins, and sup-
pressing inflammation in microglia.
Two large programs are current-
ly studying early-onset Alzheimer’s.
The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer
Network project is funded by the
U.S. National Institute on Aging with

United Kingdom, and the United
States; and the Alzheimer’s Prevention

Initiative is studying an extended
family of 5,000 with the disorder in
Antioquia, Colombia.

**Treatments for Alzheimer’s**
The FDA has now approved
five prescription drugs for
treating Alzheimer’s. While they relieve
some symptoms, they do not cure or
halt the disease. Three of these drugs
are cholinesterase inhibitors: donepez-
il, galantamine, and rivastigmine.
Cholinesterase inhibitors stop the
action of acetylcholinesterase, an
enzyme that breaks down the neu-
rotransmitter acetylcholine. This
increases the available amount of
acetylcholine (involved in learning and
memory), which counteracts the
damaging effect of the disease on
production of this neurotransmitter.
The fourth drug, memantine, is an
NMDA receptor antagonist. Normally,
NMDA receptors bind the neurotrans-
mitter glutamate, allowing calcium to
enter the neuron. In Alzheimer’s, the
damaged cells become overwhelmed
with calcium, further damaging the
neurons — a condition called neuro-
nal excitotoxicity. Memantine blocks
the flow of calcium through NMDA-
receptor channels.
The fifth approved medication
combines donepezil and memantine.
Donepezil can be used in all stages of
the disease, galantamine for mild to
moderate stages, memantine for mod-
erate to severe stages, and rivastigmine
in all stages. The donepezil/memantine
cocktail is used to treat moderate to
severe Alzheimer’s.
Several clinical trials are now un-
derway to find new and better treat-
ments for Alzheimer’s. The Alzheimer’s
Forum currently lists 14 treatments that
are in the later stages of clinical trials.
Overall, however, there is a high failure


rate for drugs on the road to approv-
al. Between 2002 and 2012, just 0.4
percent (1 in 245) of Alzheimer’s drugs
were approved. Potential drugs have
often proved ineffectual because they
don’t target Alzheimer’s early pathology.
Online registries may improve the situa-
tion by hastening participant recruit-
ment for clinical trials and looking for
people at ever-earlier stages of disease
progression. Trials are also broadening
their pool of participants to include
people likely to develop Alzheimer’s but
currently asymptomatic, as well as other
participants at the pre-dementia stage.
Another treatment strategy, based
on the amyloid hypothesis, uses the
body’s immune response to attack
and clear amyloid plaques. Trials for
active immunization (which trains the
immune system to build a person’s
antibodies) and passive immunization
(which transfers already active defen-
sive antibodies without bolstering the
person’s own immune system) have
both been explored. So far, however,
these types of therapies have been
inadequate for people with moderate
to severe symptoms.



PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Parkinson’s disease is the second
most common neurodegenerative dis-
order in humans. Like Alzheimer’s, its
incidence increases with age, with the
average onset around age 60. About 5
million people in the world’s 10 most
populous countries have Parkinson’s,
and its frequency is expected to dou-
ble by 2030. With 50,000 to 60,000
cases diagnosed annually in the U.S.,
the actual figures may be much higher
— especially since early symptoms
can be mistaken for normal aging and
thus are not reported.
From 2000 to 2013, the age-
adjusted death rates for those with



Parkinson’s disease increased in the
U.S. from 8.8 to 11.0 per 100,000
for males and from 3.9 to 4.8 per
100,000 for females. For reasons not
yet understood, the disease is more
prevalent in men than in women. Five
to 10 percent of cases are “early-onset,”
occurring before age 50. Rarer still,
patients with “juvenile Parkinsonism”
may develop symptoms before age 20.
Estimates of the prevalence, or
overall number, of Parkinson’s pa-
tients vary widely, so incidence — the
occurrence of new cases within a given
time period (for example, per year) —
is a better index for this disease. There
is a higher incidence of Parkinson’s in
developed countries but the reason is
unknown, although increased risk of
the disease has also been reported in
rural areas with increased pesticide use.



Symptoms
At first, Parkinson’s is charac-
terized by motor problems: slow
movement; muscular rigidity; poor
coordination and instability; and shak-
ing in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face
while at rest. As the disease progresses,
the shaking, known as resting tremor,
may worsen and interfere with walk-
ing, talking, and other simple tasks.
Cognitive decline often occurs at later
stages. Some people develop depres-
sion and other emotional changes,
difficulty swallowing and chewing,
skin problems, constipation or urinary
problems, and sleeping problems.
However, the rate and intensity of Par-
kinson’s progression vary. Some people
become severely disabled, while others
have only minor motor disruptions.



Pathology and Causes
Parkinson’s is a motor system
disorder caused by the loss of
dopamine-producing cells neurons


### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 101

**Neurodegenerative Diseases 15**

in the substantia nigra — a midbrain
structure that is considered part of the
basal ganglia. This brain region affects
movement, reward, and addiction. At
the cellular level, the death of neurons
likely arises as a result of damage to
mitochondrial respiration.
Some early-onset cases are linked
to mutations in the PARK2 (or
PRKN) gene, which codes for the
protein “parkin.” Most types of Parkin-
son’s are caused by a combination of
genetics and environment, but an esti-
mated 15 to 25 percent of people with
adult-onset Parkinson’s have a known
relative with the disease. Genes like
alpha-synuclein (SNCA), repeat kinase
2 (LRRK-2), and glucocerebrosidase
(GBA) also point to the importance
of genetics as a causal factor. While


Parkinson’s and Lewy body dementia
are sometimes considered different dis-
orders, Lewy bodies, accumulations of
proteins in neuron bodies, have been
implicated in both diseases. Lewy bod-
ies are mainly composed of the protein
alpha-synuclein entangled with other
proteins, including neurofilament,
ubiquitin, alpha B crystallin, and
probably tau protein in neurofibrillary
tangles. The Lewy body protein, al-
pha-synuclein, is involved in dopamine
transport in the nervous system.
There is no definitive test for
Parkinson’s so, without accepted bio-
markers, diagnosis is based on medical
history and neurological tests that can
include brain scans. Accurate diagnosis
can be difficult, because some non-Par-
kinson’s conditions display similar



symptoms. In the future, mitochon-
drial molecules could be a potential
source of a Parkinson’s biomarker.



Research
Scientists can treat mice with
the chemical MPTP (1-methyl-4-
phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) to
create an animal model that can pro-
vide further insight into Parkinson’s. In
the body, MPTP metabolizes into the
neurotoxin MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phen-
ylpyridinium), which causes a Parkin-
son’s-like loss of cells in the substantia
nigra and cognitive deficits. However,
MPTP does not perfectly mimic the
symptoms of human Parkinson’s dis-
ease, including the motor deficits.
Research on using stem cells to
replace damaged dopamine neurons


Alzheimer’s disease is associated with high levels of the beta-amyloid protein. This protein clumps together and forms plaques, which are
pictured in brown. These plaques can build up between neurons and interrupt their activities. Tau proteins also accumulate and form tangles
— seen in blue — within neurons, disrupting communications.

in Parkinson’s patients has shown
promise. There are two types of stem
cells: the more flexible (and con-
troversial) fetal tissue and induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which
are specialized adult (often blood or
skin) cells that have been repurposed
into a generalized embryonic state.
There have been successful lab studies
using iPS cells, and positive to mixed
results in clinical studies with the fetal
stem cells. A Kyoto University study,
published in August 2017, transferred
human iPS cells into the brains of
monkeys treated with MPTP. Two
years after this transplantation, the
treated monkeys were shown to have
healthy DA neuron integration,
growth, and even functioning in
the striatum.

**Treatments**
Treatment with levodopa
(L-Dopa) temporarily relieves
Parkinson’s motor symptoms but does
not slow disease progression. Ironically,
the long-term use of L-Dopa can
induce dyskinesia — abnormal and
uncontrolled involuntary movements.
Strategies for treating Parkinson’s
include gene therapy and targeting
specific cellular molecules.
A surgical procedure called deep
brain stimulation (DBS) is increas-
ingly used to treat Parkinson’s pa-
tients whose symptoms, including
rigidity, tremor, slowed movement,
and mobility problems, do not
respond adequately to medication.
The DBS technique implants a small
neurostimulator device — like a pace-
maker — that sends electrical impuls-
es that interfere with and block brain
signals that cause the motor symp-
toms of Parkinson’s. Before implant-
ing a neurostimulator into the brain,
the neurosurgeon locates where the


patient’s symptoms are originating,
using MRI or CT scans. Most often,
the problem areas in the brain are the
thalamus, the subthalamic nucleus,
and a portion of the globus pallidus
(part of the basal ganglia). After the
imaging, microelectrode recording
— which involves a small wire that
monitors the activity of nerve cells in
the target area — is sometimes used
to further localize problem areas in
the brain. This approach has proven
to be highly successful with a segment
of patients.



One treatment still in the
research stage is a strategy to break
apart Lewy bodies. The idea is to use
high hydrostatic pressure to break
apart aggregated alpha-synuclein
fibril plaques, like those found in
Lewy bodies, and return the protein
to its properly functioning form. An-
other novel approach to preventing
Parkinson’s was suggested by epide-
miological studies that found that
the disease is less common among
coffee drinkers and cigarette smok-
ers. If caffeine and nicotine offer
protection, this could reflect some
central action that benefits the brain’s
dopaminergic systems.


#### AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL

#### SCLEROSIS


ALS is a group of progressive,
ultimately fatal motor neuron diseases.
ALS is also called Lou Gehrig’s disease
after the renowned New York Yankee
first baseman, who was one of the
most famous victims of the disease.
ALS forced Gehrig to retire at age


36. Gehrig died two years later. ALS
    afflicts as many as 15,000 Americans,
    most between the ages of 50 and 70.
    Although men are slightly more likely
    than women to develop the disorder,


that difference lessens with increasing
age. For unknown reasons, non-His-
panic whites are more likely than other
ethnicities to develop ALS. Military
veterans’ likelihood of developing the
disease is as much as 1.5 to 2 times
higher than the rate in the general
population — possibly due to expo-
sure to environmental toxins like
lead and pesticides.



Symptoms
Unlike the previously discussed
neurodegenerative disorders, general-
ly neither cognition nor personality
is affected in individuals with ALS.
Early ALS symptoms include muscle

**Neurodegenerative Diseases 15**

weakness, twitching, and eventual
paralysis in the hands and feet. These
symptoms gradually spread as patients
lose strength and the ability to move,
speak, and eat. Most ALS patients
die within three to five years after
symptoms appear due to nerve dam-
age affecting the respiratory muscles.
However, 10 percent of ALS patients
— like the physicist Stephen Hawking
— survive 10 years or more.

**Pathology and Causes**
Motor neurons connect the brain
to the spinal cord and to the voluntary
muscles throughout the body. In ALS,
the motor neurons degenerate and then
die. Without this neural communica-
tion, a person’s voluntary muscles weak-
en, begin twitching, and finally atrophy.
Only 5 to 10 percent of ALS cases
are due solely due to genetic factors —
a condition called “familial ALS”; the
non-familial disease is called “sporadic
ALS.” While several genes have been
identified that increase susceptibility
to ALS, there is no clear pattern of in-
heritance. Among cases with a genetic
component, about 25 to 40 percent
are caused by a harmful mutation in
the C9ORF72 gene. Some individuals
with this mutation show symptoms
of both motor neuron and dementia
disorders, a condition known as ALS-
FTD (ALS-frontotemporal dementia).
Another 12 to 20 percent of heredi-
tary cases result from mutations that
prevent the SOD1 gene from cod-
ing for superoxide dismutase — an
enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown
of cell-damaging superoxide radicals
into more benign molecular oxygen or
hydrogen peroxide. These and other
hereditary forms of ALS, such as those
involving UBQLN2 and VEGF genes,
provide valuable insights into the me-
chanics of the disease.


Research and Treatments
There is no cure for ALS, nor
has any medication been
found that can stop or reverse its
progression. But the FDA has ap-
proved edaravone and riluzole for
treating ALS. Edaravone, an antioxi-
dant that inhibits the production of
cell-damaging free radicals, can
ameliorate disease symptoms. Riluzole
decreases glutamate levels, and has
been shown clinically to extend the life
of ALS patients by a few months.
A therapy called NurOwn, devel-
oped by BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics,
is entering a phase 3 clinical trial (to
confirm drug safety and efficacy over
a longer testing time) after showing
promise for halting or reversing ALS
progression. NurOwn uses undifferen-
tiated stem cells from the patient’s own
bone marrow, which are then modified
to boost the production of neurotroph-
ic factors that support and protect
neurons destroyed by the disease.
For those with the SOD1 mu-
tation, there is also hope for a gene
silencing technique using an artificial
RNA snippet. Lab tests in mouse
models have preserved muscle strength
and motor and respiratory functions,
and delayed disease onset and death.
This treatment has also safely silenced
SOD1 in the lower motor neurons of
nonhuman primate models.
Participation in a multidisciplinary
ALS clinic, an ALS Association Certi-
fied Treatment Center of Excellence, or
a Recognized Treatment Center can also
improve ALS patients’ quality of life.



HUNTINGTON’S DISEASE
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a
heritable disease that impairs voluntary
movement and cognition. The dis-
ease afflicts 3 to 7 people of 100,000
people of European descent, but is less



common among Japanese, Chinese, or
African populations. The HD variant
of the HTT gene is dominant; if one
parent has a single copy of the HD
gene variant and the other parent has
normal HTT genes, a child has a 50
percent chance of inheriting the HD
variant and developing the disease.
The most common form of HD be-
gins earlier than most progressive brain
diseases, becoming active when people
are in their 30s and 40s. Death occurs
15 to 20 years after a patient becomes
symptomatic. Juvenile HD begins in
childhood or adolescence, and juvenile
HD patients usually die 10 to 15 years
after their symptoms appear.



Symptoms
Signs of HD begin with irritabil-
ity, mood swings, depression, small
involuntary movements (called cho-
rea), poor coordination, and difficulty
making decisions and learning new
information. As the disease progresses,
the chorea becomes more pronounced
and patients have increasing trouble
with voluntary movements like walk-
ing, speaking, and even swallowing.
Their cognitive problems also worsen.
While juvenile HD displays the same
symptoms as the more common form,
it also includes slow movements,
clumsiness, frequent falling, rigidity,
slurred speech, and drooling. School
performance declines as thinking and
reasoning abilities become impaired,
and seizures occur in 30 to 50 percent
of children with this condition.



Causes and Genetics
In 1993, Huntington’s disease
was found to be caused by mutations
in the HTT gene, which codes for the
huntingtin protein, located on chro-
mosome 4. The protein likely inter-
acts with other proteins involved in


### 104 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**15 Neurodegenerative Diseases**

signaling, transport, binding to
proteins and other structures, and pro-
tecting the cell from self-destruction.
The disease mutation involves an ab-
normal number of repeats of a three-
part (trinucleotide or triplet) snippet
of DNA in the HTT gene. This
sequence of the nucleotides cytosine,
adenine, and guanine (CAG) normal-
ly repeats 10 to 35 times, but occurs
from 36 to 120 or more times in the
mutation. The greater the number of
CAG repeats, the earlier symptoms
appear and the more severe they are.
The “expanded” huntingtin protein
is susceptible to clumping. While
aggregated huntingtin proteins don’t
cause cell death directly, they disrupt
the mitochondrial electron transport
chain, initiating a cascade of neuronal
dysfunction and death. Brain areas
most often affected are the basal ganglia


(voluntary movement) and the cortex
(cognition, perception, and memory).



Detection and Treatments
In late 2015, Ionis Pharmaceu-
ticals began the first human
trials of a “gene silencing” or “hunting-
tin lowering” drug. IONIS-HTTRx is
an antisense oligonucleotide — a
single strand of a chemically modified
DNA designed to interrupt and
decrease the mutated form of the
huntingtin protein produced in HD
patients. The drug is now in phase 2
trials comparing it to a placebo in
early-stage HD patients who are
randomly assigned to treatment or
control groups.
In spring 2017, the FDA ap-
proved the drug deutetrabenazine for
treating chorea associated with Hun-
tington’s disease. This is reportedly



only the second product approved for
treating HD. Furthermore, there is
now evidence for viable HD biomark-
ers. Tau (which turns up regularly
in neurodegenerative diseases) and
neurofilament light chain, a compo-
nent of the neuronal cytoskeleton, are
found at elevated levels in cerebro-
spinal fluid of HD patients. A recent
study points to the neurofilament
light chain, and to a lesser extent tau,
as viable HD biomarkers. Interest-
ingly, the neurofilament light chain is
also being investigated as a biomarker
for ALS and other neurodegenera-
tive diseases. In mouse studies, the
amount of neurofilament light chain
found in the animals’ cerebral spi-
nal fluid and blood increased before
neurological signs appeared, likely
coinciding with the development of
brain lesions.

s you’ve seen in previous
chapters, neuroscientific
research has made astounding
advances in the past 150 years. The
development of new research tools
and technologies has driven these
discoveries, from the first images
of individual neurons to revealing
the genetic causes of neurological
disorders. This chapter introduces
you to some of the most important
research methods used to understand
the brain, including unusual types
of microscopy, animal models, and
cutting-edge molecular techniques.



TOOLS FOR ANATOMY
Anatomy is the study of
structure — most often, the
structure of biological organisms. For
the brain, anatomy starts with the
structure of neurons, which are among
the most complex and diverse cell
types in our bodies. Scientists were
first able to observe neurons in the late
19th century, thanks to histological
techniques that start with a very thin
slice of brain tissue to which scientists
apply stains or other compounds that
add contrast or color to specific
structures. They then view the tissue
with a light microscope, which passes
visible light through the thin slice and
lenses that make the structures look up
to 1,000 times larger than they do
with the naked eye.
Histology is the study of how cells
form tissues. Histological techniques
can reveal changes in the density of
cell types or the presence of molecules
that can suggest a particular disease.
These techniques have helped illu-
minate the brain changes underlying
some neurodegenerative disorders. For
example, histological methods have
shown that an enzyme that breaks
down acetylcholine is associated with

the brain plaques and tangles of Alz-
heimer’s disease. And in the brains of
Parkinson’s disease patients, histology
has revealed the death of neurons that
normally control movements through
dopamine signaling.
Long after light microscopes gave
scientists their first glimpses of neu-
rons, a debate bubbled in the scientific
community: Are neurons individual
cells or a mesh of physically intercon-
nected cell bodies? Neurons are so
densely packed that the answer wasn’t
clear until the 1950s, after the devel-
opment of a new technology called
electron microscopy. Electron micro-
scopes can produce useful detailed
images of cellular structures magnified
many 100,000s of times by directing
a beam of electrons through very thin
slices of tissue, then enlarging and
focusing the image with electromag-
netic lenses. With this technology,
researchers were finally able to see that
neurons are not physically continuous
but, instead, are individual cells.
Although they are individual cells,
neurons do act in networks, communi-
cating across small gaps called syn-
apses, where the axon terminal of one
cell meets a dendrite or cell body of
another cell. One method for mapping
the signaling pathways within these
networks involves injecting radioactive
molecules or “tracers” into the cell
body of a neuron. Researchers monitor
the movement of radioactivity down
the neuron’s axon, showing where
that neuronal path leads. A similar
technique involves tracers that can
actually travel across synapses, from
one neuron to the next. Scientists have
used such tracers to map the complex
pathways by which information travels
from the eyes to the visual cortex.
Another technique for examining
brain anatomy is magnetic resonance


imaging, or MRI. Developed in the
1980s, MRI is widely used by research-
ers and doctors to view a detailed im-
age of brain structure. MRI equipment
uses radio waves and strong magnets
to create images of the brain based on
the distribution of water within its
tissues. MRI is harmless and painless to
the person being scanned, although it
does require sitting or lying in a narrow
tube, and the procedure can be quite
noisy. With an MRI scan, researchers
can tell the difference between the
brain’s gray matter and white matter.
Gray matter consists of the cell bodies
of neurons, as well as their dendrites
and synapses. White matter mostly
contains axons wrapped in the fatty
myelin coating that gives these regions
their white color. Based on the distri-
bution of water in the tissues, MRI
images clearly differentiate between
cerebrospinal fluid, the water-rich cells
of gray matter, and fatty white matter.



TOOLS FOR PHYSIOLOGY
Information is conveyed along
the neuronal pathways that
crisscross through our brains as
electrical activity traveling down axons.
To study this activity, researchers
measure changes in the electrical
charge of individual neurons using
techniques of electrophysiology. A thin
glass electrode is placed inside a
neuron to measure the voltage across
its cell membrane, which changes
when the neuron is activated. This
technique can measure neuron activity
inside the brains of living lab animals
such as rats or mice, enabling scientists
to study how neurons transmit
electrical information in their normal
physical context. Alternatively, a slice
of brain can be kept “alive” for a short
time in a Petri dish, if the right
environment (temperature, pH, ion



concentrations, etc.) is provided. In an
isolated brain slice, researchers can
better identify the exact cell they are
recording from and can infuse drugs
into the Petri dish to determine their
effects on the brain.
Using these methods, scientists
have made critical discoveries about
synaptic plasticity — the capacity of a
synapse to become stronger or weak-
er in response to sensory inputs or
other activity. For example, repeatedly
stimulating a neuron by training an
animal in a particular task, or by direct
electrical stimulation, increases the
synaptic strength and the chance that
the downstream neuron will react to
the incoming signal.
A disadvantage of electrophysiolo-
gy, as described above, is that the tech-
niques are highly invasive. However,
another method, called electroenceph-
alography or EEG, is able to record
human brain activity without invasive
or harmful procedures. In EEG, about
20 thin metal discs are placed on the
scalp. Each disk is connected by thin
wires to a machine that records the
activity of neurons near the brain sur-
face. This approach has been especially
useful for understanding epilepsy and
the stages of sleep. However, it does
not provide information at the level of
individual neurons.
Researchers who need to look at
individual neurons in a living brain can
use a technique called two-photon mi-
croscopy. A lab animal such as a fly or
mouse must be genetically modified so
that some of its neurons produce a pro-
tein that glows when a laser beam shines
on them. Two-photon microscopy has
enabled scientists to understand chang-
es in the brain during normal processes
like learning, as well as changes that
occur over the course of a disease — for
example, watching how the branches on

neurons near Alzheimer’s-like plaques
break down over time.

**TOOLS FOR GENETICS**
The human genome is made
up of 3 billion pairs of DNA
letters or “bases.” This multitude of
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G),
and thymine (T) bases comprises an
estimated 20,000 genes that spell out
instructions for making proteins, along
with regulatory and other non-coding
DNA regions whose functions are not
fully known. Scientists study genetics
in many ways, such as following
diseases or other traits through family
pedigrees or identifying the exact order
of DNA bases (the DNA “sequence”)
that code for a given trait. More recent
genetic tools enable scientists to
manipulate genes and other genetic
features to better understand how the
brain works and how to treat it in cases
of dysfunction or disease.
Scientists often don’t know which
gene or other DNA feature controls a
trait. At the outset, a particular trait
could be encoded on any of the 23
pairs of chromosomes in a typical
human cell. But with genetic linkage
studies, researchers have begun to map
gene locations. First, researchers must
identify another trait with a _known_
chromosomal location that tends to
be inherited with or “linked” to the
trait of interest. This technique, which
narrows down the likely location of
the gene of interest, was the first step
toward identifying the genetic basis of
many neurological disorders.
When you think about muta-
tions, you probably think of harmful
changes in one or several DNA bases
within a gene. But some disorders re-
sult from an overabundance of copies
or repeats of a stretch of DNA. This
is the case with Huntington’s disease.


The normal HTT gene has about a
dozen repeats of a small stretch of
DNA within the gene, but Hunting-
ton’s patients can have more than
100 of these repeats. Researchers now
use DNA chips or microarrays to
identify such variations in copy num-
ber. The “array” of a microarray refers
to the thousands of spots arrayed in
rows and columns on the surface of
the chip; each spot contains a known
DNA sequence or gene, which can
grab onto corresponding bits of the
genome being analyzed. Using this
tool, scientists are able to compare
DNA samples of two people, perhaps
one healthy and one with a disorder,
to see if certain pieces of DNA are
repeated more in one person than in
the other. Another type of microar-
ray helps researchers determine if a
patient has a chromosomal translo-
cation — a chunk of a chromosome
that has been misplaced onto
another chromosome.
Recent years have seen great ad-
vances in DNA sequencing methods,
allowing researchers to more efficiently
and affordably explore the exact DNA
sequence that might underlie brain
disorders. In the early 2000s, the Hu-
man Genome Project made public the
vast majority of the human genome
sequence; in the years that followed,
the science of genomics has enhanced
scientists’ understanding of brain func-
tion at the level of genes, cells, and
circuits. Genomics can help identify
genetic variations that cause conditions
ranging from depression to schizophre-
nia to movement disorders.
Genetics research now goes far
beyond reading the sequence of bases
in the genome. In the last few years,
scientists have harnessed a molecular
tool that can edit the genome more
precisely and efficiently than was



previously possible. This tool, called
CRISPR (which stands for Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palin-
dromic Repeats), evolved as a bacte-
rial immune system that targets viral
invaders. Scientists have harnessed
CRISPR’s components to home in
on specific DNA sequences in lab
animals and human cell cultures. By
tethering DNA-cutting enzymes to
this targeting system, scientists can
recreate mutations found in patients
with neurological disorders, or even
insert new bits of DNA to test their
effect. With CRISPR, scientists have
been able to mimick Alzheimer’s in
rodents, in order to study the disease
and its potential treatments. CRISPR
is also used to study mutated human
neurons in Petri dishes. Research-
ers can observe how mutations that
cause autism, Parkinson’s disease,
or other conditions affect neuronal
growth and function.
Optogenetics is another fasci-
nating intersection of genetic tools
with brain science. This ingenious
technique allows researchers to control
brain activity with flashes of light.
Scientists genetically modify a lab
animal like a mouse so that its neurons
produce a light-responsive protein.
Then, optical fibers are inserted into
the brain to allow light to shine on
those neurons — either activating
or silencing them. Optogenetics has
helped scientists better understand
how neurons work together in circuits.
This technique has also been used to
control animal behaviors ranging from
sleep to drug addiction.
Oddly enough, genetics is not
always about genes. As mentioned
above, much of the human genome
contains DNA sequences that are not
genes, whose job is to regulate gene
activity. These regulatory sequences,


### 108 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience

**16 Kinds of Research**

and the enzymes that make changes
to them, help determine under what
conditions (in what cells, at what age,
etc.) a gene is expressed or repressed.
These epigenetic changes occur in
cells when chemical tags are placed on
the regulatory regions of certain genes;
the tags influence whether those genes
will be turned on or off. In the past
decade, epigenetics research has begun
to clarify the role of gene regulation
in brain development and learning.
Epigenetics has also revealed how
mutations in the regulatory regions of
DNA can cause disease, just as muta-
tions can in genes.

**Genetics in
Neurological Diseases**
The impact of mutations varies
from person to person, and from dis-
ease to disease. A particular mutation
might explain some cases of a disorder
but not others, or it could be only
one of several genetic changes affect-
ing a patient. Lissencephaly is a brain
malformation in which the surface of
the brain is smooth, unlike normal
brains whose surfaces have ridges and
grooves. It affects development. Babies
with lissencephaly start having spasms
in the first months of life and develop
drug-resistant epilepsy and severe intel-
lectual and motor disabilities. Although
about 70 percent of these patients have
mutations in the LIS1 gene, at least two
other mutations have been associated
with the condition. Another complex
genetic condition, Kabuki syndrome,
is marked by intellectual disabilities,
a distinctive facial appearance, slow
growth in infancy, and other physical
problems. Kabuki syndrome is hard to
diagnose because some symptoms, such
as intellectual disability, range from
mild to severe. DNA sequencing has
found that most patients, but not all,


have mutations in the KMT2D gene
— and some patients carry the muta-
tions in only some of their cells. In ad-
dition, people with Kabuki syndrome
may have mutations in other genes that
function like KMT2D.
It is also possible for a person
to carry a mutation but exhibit no
outward signs. Fragile X syndrome, the
most common form of congenital intel-
lectual disability in males, is caused by
an excessive number of DNA sequence
(CGG) repeats within the FMR1 gene.
The protein product of the FMR1
gene, which is important for synapse
function, is disrupted by these repeats.
While some people with elevated num-
bers of the sequence repeats may not be
affected, they are carriers with a risk of
passing it on to their children.



TOOLS FOR BEHAVIOR
To understand how brain
function drives behaviors in
humans, researchers often turn to
animal models. An eight-inch long
marine slug may not look like a very
promising model of brain function but,
over the years, the animal known as
Aplysia has helped scientists uncover
many principles of learning and memo-
r y. Aplysia has relatively few neurons
(around 10,000, compared to approxi-
mately 86 billion in humans), but
some of its neurons are large enough to
be seen with the naked eye. Aplysia also
exhibits simple behaviors that can be
modified with training. For example,
Aplysia will reflexively withdraw its gill
after receiving an electric shock to its
tail. It can be trained to withdraw its
gill in response to an innocuous touch
which, during training, was paired with
an electric shock. Scientists have
discovered how the timing of training
sessions affects learning, and have
identified proteins and other molecules



that strengthen synapses so the neuro-
nal response is greater the next time
Aplysia is stimulated. Many of the
molecules and processes identified in
Aplysia ’s learning are also involved in
human learning.
The fruit fly Drosophila is also
commonly used to study behavior,
especially how genes control behavior.
For example, variations in a gene called
‘foraging’ determine whether flies
tend to roam around as they eat or sit
in one place. Flies with mutations in
another gene called ‘timeless’ don’t have
normal circadian rhythms. Mutations
have been identified that affect the full
gamut of Drosophila behaviors — from
aggression to courtship, as well as learn-
ing and memory. Many of the affected
genes have correlates in humans.
Addiction presents one of the
most pressing challenges in studying
human behavior — how to better un-
derstand it and how to treat it. Some
lab animals like rats will consume
alcohol and drugs even if accompa-
nied by a bitter taste or foot shock.
Scientists have uncovered changes in
the brains of animals exhibiting such
addiction-like behaviors that mirror
changes seen in the brains of humans
with addiction disorders. Interestingly,
some breeds of rats are very likely to
exhibit addiction and relapse behaviors
while others are more resistant. By
comparing the genetics of two breeds
of rats with different predispositions to
cocaine addiction, scientists identified
genes that were differentially turned
on or off in the two breeds; the study
suggests that these genes, and their
epigenetic regulation, play a role in
susceptibility to addiction. This type
of research helps scientists understand
why some people are more prone to
addiction or relapse, and could suggest
ways to identify people at risk.


### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 109

**Kinds of Research 16**


Behavior is also studied directly
in humans. Early mapping of human
behaviors to specific brain regions was
done by observing personality changes
in people who had lost small regions of
their brain due to injuries or surger-
ies. For example, people who have
lost their frontal lobe often become
inconsiderate and impulsive. Modern
imaging techniques, described in great-
er detail below, also help scientists
to pair brain regions with certain be-
haviors. For example, imaging allows
researchers to see certain brain areas
“light up” when a person is shown hu-
man faces, but not when they see faces
of other animals. These techniques are
also useful to better understand brain
disorders — such as identifying brain
regions responsible for auditory hallu-
cinations in schizophrenia.



TOOLS FOR BIOCHEMISTRY
Although we talk a lot about
the electrical signals transmit-
ted along neurons, the brain also
communicates with molecular and
chemical signals. Neurotransmitters are
chemical messengers that travel across a
synapse, carrying signals from one
neuron to the next. Using a method
called microdialysis, researchers can
monitor neurotransmitters in action.
With thin tubes inserted into the brain,
scientists are able to collect tiny
volumes of liquid from just outside
neurons and then analyze the com-
pounds in that liquid. For example, a
researcher could analyze liquid captured
during learning to identify molecules
that are important for that process.
Microdialysis can also be used
to deliver compounds to the brain.
Many drugs have powerful effects on
the brain, so scientists can use these
substances to tweak brain function
in order to understand it better.


Because its nervous system is much simpler than that of a mammal, the sea slug _Aplysia_
was an important animal model in early studies on the neurobiology learning and memory.

Pharmacology, the study of the effects
of drugs, is also dedicated to identi-
fying new drugs to treat conditions
like pain or psychiatric illness, as well
as understanding addiction and other
negative consequences of drug use.
Another important method
employed to study the molecules and
chemicals at work in the brain is mass
spectrometry. Once a sample has been
collected — perhaps by using micro-
dialysis — the compounds it contains
are ionized (given an electric charge)
and then sent through an electric or
magnetic field. The behavior of each
molecule in that field indicates its
mass. That information alone pro-
vides valuable clues for identifying a
molecule. Mass spectrometry has also
been very useful in exploring neuro-
degenerative disorders. For example,
one treatment for Parkinson’s disease
causes severe side effects, includ-
ing involuntary movements. With
mass spectrometry, researchers have
identified the location within the
brain where this side effect is caused;
that information could point the way
to interventions that can reduce or
prevent those side effects.

**TOOLS USED FOR
HUMAN RESEARCH**
Many of the methods we have
discussed are too invasive to
use in humans. But several methods for
imaging human brain function do _not_
require holes in the skull or other lasting
physical changes. Functional MRI
(fMRI) can be used to follow changes in
the brain activity of a person lying
inside an MRI scanner. The machine is
tuned so that it detects blood flow as
well as differences in oxygen-rich and
oxygen-poor blood, based on the idea
that more active regions of the brain
need more oxygen and nutrients, which

are supplied by fresh oxygenated blood.
While this is an indirect indication of
neuron activity, it can pinpoint brain
activity to fairly small regions.
fMRI provides an indirect view of
neuron activity, but magnetoencepha-
lography (MEG) detects actual electri-
cal currents coursing through groups
of neurons. When neuron activities are
synchronized, their combined electri-
cal currents produce weak magnetic
fields that MEG equipment can detect.
A person undergoing the procedure
sits or lies down, with his or her head
surrounded by a helmet-shaped device
that can sense magnetic fields. MEG
has been useful in a variety of studies:
from how the auditory cortex responds
to sounds to identifying where epilep-
tic seizures start in a patient’s brain.
MEG is useful for detecting rapid
changes in brain activity (temporal
resolution) but it does not provide the
precise location of that activity (spatial
resolution). For this reason, researchers
can combine MEG data with fMRI
data to obtain good anatomical detail
from fMRI and high-speed readings of
brain activity from MEG.
Near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) is similar to fMRI in that
it monitors the flow of oxygenated
blood as a way to estimate neuron
activity. A major difference is that
NIRS is only useful for measuring
activity near the surface of the brain
and does not provide as much detail;
however, it is far less expensive and
cumbersome than fMRI. NIRS is also
more comfortable for the person un-
dergoing the procedure, as the setup
essentially involves wearing a cap with
wiring hooked to it. Some of the wires
transmit harmless laser beams (~1


megawatt of power or less) into the
brain while others detect the light af-
ter it travels through the brain. NIRS
can be used to determine the extent of
brain injuries and to monitor oxygen
levels in the brains of patients under
anesthesia. Because of its portability,
NIRS is very useful for studying brain
activity during tasks — such as driv-
ing down the highway — that can’t
take place inside an fMRI scanner.
Positron emission tomography
(PET) detects short-lived radioactive
compounds that have been injected
into the bloodstream. The radioac-
tive compounds could be oxygen or
glucose, or they might be a neurotrans-
mitter. PET traces where these com-
pounds go in the body. The location
of labeled oxygen can indicate blood
flow, while a labeled neurotransmitter
can show which brain regions are using
that signaling molecule. PET can also
detect the amyloid plaques that are a
hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease; this
technique could one day enable us to
identify the disease in its early stages.
Although PET has good temporal res-
olution like MEG, it lacks the detailed
spatial resolution of MRI.
Some methods used in human
research can change brain activity.
In transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS), a coil that generates a mag-
netic field is placed near a person’s
head. The magnetic field can pene-
trate the skull, temporarily activating
or silencing a region of the cortex.
TMS is used to treat psychiatric
disorders such as anxiety, depression,
and post-traumatic stress disorder
and could be an effective option for
patients with conditions that do not
respond to medications.



Although neuroscience has
progressed by leaps and bounds since
neurons were first viewed under a mi-
croscope, many phenomena observed
with these techniques are not fully
understood. For example, mysteries
still surround data obtained with EEG.
EEG shows that several different brain
regions have characteristic rhythms
or oscillations — one pattern in the
visual cortex, another in the sensory
motor cortex, and so on. Even though
this method of examining brain
activity has been used since 1929, the
generation of these patterns (some-
times called brain waves) at the level of
neural circuits is not well understood.
One branch of neuroscience that
can help bridge findings from the
microscopic to the whole-brain level is
computational neuroscience. Research-
ers in this field develop theories or
models about how the brain processes
information, then test these models
against real-world data. For example,
they can examine the data and imag-
es from EEG or fMRI, then develop
mathematical models to explain the
underlying neuron and circuit activity.
Data from the many methods discussed
in this chapter — electrophysiology,
molecular studies, anatomy, and func-
tional brain scans — can all contribute
to these computational models.
This chapter provides an intro-
duction to research methods that have
driven, and continue to drive, discov-
ery in neuroscience. As new techniques
and technologies emerge, scientists
will add them to their repertoire of
techniques that can deepen our under-
standing of the brain and suggest new
ways to help people whose lives are
affected by brain disorders.


#### BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE


If you know someone
with severe neurological
damage — perhaps cerebral palsy,
trauma from a car or motorcycle acci-
dent, a military or sports injury, or a
stroke — you’ve seen, firsthand, how
communicating with the outside world
and performing daily tasks can be a
challenge. But during the past few
decades, scientists have made impressive
progress in developing technologies that
can bypass such damage. Now brain-ma-
chine interfaces can read the activity of
millions of neurons — through electro-
encephalographic (EEG) activity from
the brain’s surface or from implanted
electrodes — and predict the behavioral
intentions of research participants. These
advances give human and animal
subjects neural control of parts of their
surroundings: from computer cursors to
video games to robotic limbs.
Despite the sci-fi sizzle, most of
the work on electronic brain implants
is derived from basic research on how
animals and people plan and control
various types of movement. Using
hair-thin wires inserted into the brains
of monkeys and rats, scientists first
recorded the firing patterns of cells lo-
cated in the premotor, primary motor,
and posterior parietal cortical areas of
the brain. As the animals performed
repetitive tasks like pressing a lever to
receive a reward, researchers found spe-
cific firing patterns associated with the
motion. Eventually, these patterns were
translated into computer algorithms
that allowed animals to complete a task
via a robotic arm or prosthetic device
simply by thinking about it.
The clinical applications of
brain-machine interfaces quickly became
clear. Neuroscientists and surgeons im-
planted electrode arrays in the brains of
patients with epilepsy, paralysis, stroke,

**Solving Human Problems 17**

or Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS), in hopes
of enabling them to communicate and,
someday, move independently. In early
experiments, patients were only able to
gain rudimentary control of a computer
cursor. But a breakthrough occurred in
2011 when, after months of extensive
training, quadriplegic patients learned to
control movements of a third (robotic)
arm — enabling them to grasp a drink
of water or reach out to a loved one.
Honing this technology is allowing
patients to control their own paralyzed
limbs. Electrode chips implanted in
their brains are connected to sleeves
or gloves worn over the injured limbs.
Sending tiny blasts of electricity into the
patient’s nerves, located under the sleeve
or glove, can reanimate paralyzed mus-
cles. But brain-machine interfaces won’t
become part of clinical medicine until
they’re simplified, miniaturized, and
made more reliable. Devices that wire-
lessly transmit commands from brain
implants are a step in that direction.
A parallel line of research has
explored applying this technology in the
broader field of neuroprostheses. Neuro-
prosthetic devices not only receive out-
put commands from a patient’s nervous
system, but can also provide input — as
occurs in retinal implants and prosthetic
limbs. Prosthetic arms, for example,
have remained frustratingly low-tech,
but some brain-guided prostheses
have integrated nerves and muscles at
several different levels, allowing users to
perform more precise and natural move-
ments, and even enabling some to “feel”
again. Still, even the most sophisticated
neuroprostheses (such as brain implants)
are limited by their number of elec-
trodes and the lifespan of the implanted
electrodes. Current arrays can only
connect to 100 or so neurons, so a more
complex and useful bionic future is still
far away. Yet scientists and entrepreneurs


are already thinking of new uses for the
technology: restoring memory; enhanc-
ing cognition; and treating diseases such
as depression, Alzheimer’s, and epilepsy.



DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION
Insights into the pathophysiolo-
gy of movement disorders have
rekindled interest in the use of focused
electrical stimulation as a form of
treatment. The most advanced and
precise method — deep brain stimula-
tion (DBS) — was inspired by pacemak-
ers engineered for the heart. Instead of
electrodes implanted in the heart, the
electrodes of the DBS device are surgical-
ly embedded in specific brain regions.
Depending on where the electrodes are
placed, DBS devices can help alleviate
the symptoms of some brain disorders.
During most of these implantation
surgeries, patients remain awake so that
a neurologist can talk to them and en-
sure that the electrodes are stimulating
the correct locations. While the patient’s
head is held in place with a stereotactic
frame, the surgeon drills a dime-sized
hole (or smaller) in the skull. Then, a



thin insulated wire with electrodes at
the tip or along the shaft is inserted
deep into the brain; if both sides of the
brain are to receive implants, a wire is
inserted into each side. In a separate
surgery, a battery-operated pulse gen-
erator is implanted in the upper chest
and connected to the electrodes. When
the device is turned on, it starts sending
electrical currents that alter the activity
of the targeted brain cells.
The implanted device relies on the
fact that neuronal communication uses
electrical signals. In many movement
disorders, an abnormal signal or pulse
can gain control of a circuit and can
easily become magnified. Like someone
shouting in a crowded room, this aber-
rant signal can drown out other activity.
DBS interrupts the shouting, so that
normal communication can continue.
To determine where brain activity
needs to be silenced or induced, neu-
rosurgeons must identify the locations
of the problems. The brain areas first
targeted for tremors and Parkinson’s
disease were chosen after years of pains-
taking neuroimaging, neuroanatomy,



Advances in brain-machine interfaces are leading to incredible treatments, like this
prosthetic arm that is controlled through thought.

and fundamental research, especially
in nonhuman primate models. Since
then, deep brain stimulation has been
used to treat epilepsy, dystonia, To-
urette’s syndrome and, more recently,
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Now
researchers are investigating whether
the DBS technique can potentially be
extended to mood disorders such as
treatment-resistant depression, as well
as other complex mental disorders.
Yet DBS, like any surgical proce-
dure, is not without some risks. It is
highly invasive, and potential compli-
cations include infection, stroke, and
bleeding in the brain. It also requires
regular neurological follow-up and
battery changes every 3 to 4 years.

**PSYCHOACTIVE THERAPIES
Transcranial Stimulation**
A few noninvasive treatments
can stimulate cells near the surface
of the brain: Transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS), and tran-
scranial alternating current stimulation
(tACS) all use magnetic fields or low


electrical currents to alter neural activ-
ity in a specific region of the human
cortex and, indirectly, deeper brain
structures to which it connects.
During TMS therapy, patients sit
in a chair while a nurse or technician
places a magnetic stimulator against their
head. The device painlessly delivers brief
magnetic pulses to the brain, similar in
strength to those generated by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) devices, but
highly targeted. For patients with depres-
sion, pulses are focused over their left
prefrontal cortex. Here, they generate
electrical currents among neurons which,
over time, help lift the patient’s mood.
Similarly, tDCS uses one or two
milliamperes of direct current to tune
the brain. Although research into
tDCS and its close cousin, tACS, is in
its early stages, these techniques offer
clear advantages over deep brain stim-
ulation and even over TMS. Generally,
patients report only a slight tingling
or tapping feeling on their head as the
therapy is administered. The devices
used to administer these therapies are
also cheaper, more portable, and lower



-tech compared to TMS and DBS.
A number of studies have sug-
gested that tDCS and tACS might be
used to improve working memory as
well as to relieve chronic pain and the
symptoms of depression, fibromyalgia,
schizophrenia, and other disorders.
However, despite the substantial
literature, meta-analyses have failed
to conclusively prove any effects of
transcranial electrical stimulation. Cur-
rently, there is no consensus among
scientists on how these treatments
might work, or even on the best way
to position the stimulation devices.



New Types of Drugs
Most doctors still recommend
medication as the first line of treat-
ment for neurological and psychiatric
disorders. The antidepressants, antipsy-
chotics, and other mind-altering med-
ications used today have been tested
in extensive clinical trials and remain
largely unchanged from their proto-
types developed in the 1950s. Each
of these classes of drugs is now filled
with subsequent generations of closely


Deep brain stimulation uses electrodes implanted deep in the brain, which carry electric impulses to specific brain regions. The power packs
that provide the electricity are implanted in the patient’s back, as seen in this X-ray.

related drugs designed to interact more
selectively with their targets, producing
better therapeutic effects and fewer side
effects, in some cases. Nevertheless,
these are just slightly improved copies
of one another. Truly novel drug candi-
dates are rare, and hard to develop.
One of the biggest challenges in
developing new drugs to treat neu-
rological or psychiatric problems is
finding molecules that can cross the
protective blood-brain barrier — tight-
ly packed endothelial cells lining blood
vessels restrict the kinds of molecules
that can enter the brain. While this
barrier’s fortress-like quality is good
for normal function, it prevents most
drugs delivered by typical means —
including pills, patches, injections,
or enemas — from having any useful
therapeutic effects within the brain.
Scientists have had to design extreme-
ly tiny molecules or adopt ingenious
strategies such as nanoparticles that
shuttle in drugs, enzymes that activate
molecules after they’ve “snuck through”
the barrier, and antibodies that were
specifically engineered for the brain.


Preliminary trials of drugs that
use the body’s own immune system to
confront and clear unwanted proteins
from the brain have sparked a great
deal of interest, particularly in the
Alzheimer’s disease community. When
mice and monkeys receive a vaccine
that contains a major component
of amyloid plaques, their immune
systems develop antibodies capable of
traveling to the brain and “tagging” the
amyloid-beta plaques that are the hall-
mark of Alzheimer’s disease. This tag-
ging seems to alert microglial cells in
the brain, which head for the plaques
and try to remove them. In some
experiments, mice bred to develop an
Alzheimer’s-like disease remembered
how to navigate through a Morris
water maze, after being vaccinated —
indicating that such vaccines might
also relieve symptoms of the disease.
In the past, however, many Alzhei-
mer’s vaccines have failed in later-stage
clinical trials. One reason for these
failures was the development of harmful
side effects. Several human participants
experienced severe inflammation when



their brains reacted to the antibodies
against its proteins. Since then, newer
approaches have engineered antibodies
or antibody fragments that bind to
their specific targets without triggering
an autoimmune response. Other re-
searchers have engineered double-duty
antibodies. These use one end to sneak
into the brain by binding to a receptor
on the blood-brain barrier. Once inside,
the antibody’s other end can cut off
production of harmful amyloid-
beta proteins even before plaques form.
By contrast, some therapies aim
to boost helpful peptides and proteins
called trophic factors, which are native
to the brain. Neurotrophic factors
support the growth and survival of
specific groups of neurons. Scientists
hope to modify these factors to reduce
the amount of cell death in various
neurodegenerative diseases.
The possible value of at least one
trophic factor — nerve growth factor
(NGF) — has already been demon-
strated in several preclinical and early
stage clinical trials. NGF slows the
destruction of cholinergic neurons that
plays a role in the cognitive decline
of Alzheimer’s disease. Injecting NGF
into patients’ brains stimulated the
regeneration of these neurons and
induced sprouting of new nerve fibers
around the injection site. In some cas-
es, evidence of this sprouting lasted up
to 10 years after the initial therapy.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) is showing potential for
treating Alzheimer’s disease, as well
as Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, ALS,
and Rett syndrome. Moreover, the
effects of boosting BDNF could even
be stronger than those of NGF. But,
in an interesting twist, the inhibition
of some neurotrophic factors such as
the neurite outgrowth inhibitor might
also benefit patients. Studies have

found that neurite outgrowth inhibitor
is upregulated in the early stages of
motor disease, and having too much of
it around could prevent nerve regen-
eration. Scientists are now conducting
clinical trials in which patients with
ALS and spinal cord injuries receive
custom-made antibodies to disable the
neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein.
Ultimately, the ever-increasing
global demand for therapies for neuro-
logical and mental diseases is a strong
motivator for scientists and doctors in
this field.

**PREDICTIVE NEUROIMAGING
AND PERSONALIZED
MEDICINE**
As we gain understanding of
the anatomical and functional
changes underlying neurological
illnesses, it becomes increasingly clear
that these changes provide clues for
earlier detection — even before
symptoms appear. Many disorders,
such as Alzheimer’s disease, are accom-
panied by specific brain activity and
structural changes that can be tracked
over time using MRI. By comparing
this information with a baseline model
of a healthy brain, researchers hope to
predict which patients might one day
develop neurological problems.
Although it is still too early for
these “markers” to be used as clinical
reference points, they could pave the
way for objective diagnoses of brain
disorders, much as electrocardiograms
and laboratory tests are currently used
to reveal heart problems. The first
step in this process is to produce a
generic brain template by averaging
the images from hundreds of random-
ly selected MRI scans. Scientists can
then use machine-learning software to
characterize the sets of healthy brain
scans and the sets of scans known to


show disease-associated changes.
Data from predictive neuroimaging
can also be useful for guiding person-
alized treatment options and assessing
a treatment’s clinical effectiveness.
In studies of major depression, for
example, patients whose brain scans
showed an overactive amygdala (a brain
region involved in emotional process-
ing) were more likely to respond to
psychotherapy. However, patients who
exhibited higher activity in the anterior
insula (another brain region involved
in emotions) tended to improve with
medication, but not with psychother-
apy. In the future, psychiatrists could
offer patients the best possible course of
treatment based on their own biological
characteristics, rather than relying only
on symptoms or treatment preferences.



CELLULAR MARKERS
In the past few years, a
growing number of clinicians
and scientists have rejected the bound-
aries of conventional DSM (Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders)-defined diagnostic proto-
cols that mental health professionals
usually rely on. Rather than analyzing
symptoms such as sadness, fatigue, or
lack of sleep, the focus has shifted to
finding biological markers that provide
objective indices of those symptoms.
Much like neuroimaging, cellular
markers could be used to predict a pa-
tient’s risk and diagnosis before disease
symptoms become obvious, as well as
indicate how a patient may respond to
certain treatments. The markers may
be proteins, lipids, hormones, nucleic
acids, or other compounds that can be
detected in samples of blood, urine,
saliva, or cerebrospinal fluid.
Although neuropsychiatric research
on biomarkers still lags behind other
fields such as oncology, researchers are



investigating associations between genet-
ic and cellular mechanisms and various
mental disorders. A single biological
cause for a mental disorder is hard to pin
down — in fact, many skeptics say it is
impossible to understand mental illness
solely by understanding the brain. Caus-
es of mental disorders are very complex
and not easy to decipher. And yet, recent
technological advances are enabling
scientists to decipher more of the brain’s
mysteries. Researchers can look deeper
into the brain with imaging technology,
map the circuits underlying specific
mental states, and study how chemical
levels change in individual neurons. Bio-
markers reflect these physiological con-
ditions, and studying them could lead
to better targets for treatments. If chosen
carefully, biomarkers might even provide
useful ways to compare the effectiveness
of treatments between patients, as well
as in future clinical trials.



CELL TRANSPLANT
To find new treatments for
schizophrenia, stroke, Parkin-
son’s disease and other debilitating
diseases, researchers around the world
are turning to stem cells to study the
biology of the diseases and disorders.
These undifferentiated cells — from
embryos or from certain adult tissues
— have the remarkable potential to
develop into any of the three major cell
types of the brain: neurons; astrocytes,
which nourish and protect neurons; and
oligodendrocytes, which surround axons
and enable them to conduct signals
efficiently. Scientists hope that stem cells
transplanted into the brain might be
able to replace and repair neural cells
that were lost due to disease or injury.
In mice, stem cell therapy has re-
versed the signs of serious spinal cord
injury. Within weeks of treatment,
researchers observed that previously


### society for neuroscience| Brain Facts 117

**Solving Human Problems 17**

paralyzed mice could walk again. So
far, only a few small trials of fetal and
stem cell grafts have been conducted in
humans. Some of the patients treated
showed meaningful recovery from
otherwise hard-to-treat disorders like
stroke and Parkinson’s. Other trials
were not successful, with replacement
cells starting to produce excessive
amounts of dopamine.
Thus, there are several challenges to
overcome before successful use of neural
stem cell transplant therapy. Embryonic
cells and adult stem cells are difficult to
harness and transplant into the brain.
Controlling where and how stem cells
differentiate into the necessary replace-
ment cells is also tricky. Furthermore,
stem cells carry a risk of being rejected
by the recipient’s immune system.
Scientists have recently discovered how
to convert a patient’s own brain cells
directly into dopamine neurons, which
eliminates many risks, but the proce-
dures are far from standard. None of
them has yet been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.

**GENE REPLACEMENT**
As researchers work to improve
the safety and efficacy of
genetic and cellular treatments,
neuroscientists are finding new ways to
deliver therapeutic genes into cells that
need them. Designing therapies able to
breach the blood-brain barrier is a
challenge. Recent research has shown
that small viruses with healthy genes
tucked inside are able to cross the
blood-brain barrier and replace faulty
genes. Currently, adeno-associated
virus and lentivirus seem to be the
safest and most efficient vectors for
gene therapy. These vectors are being
used in clinical trials in patients with
Parkinson’s and for some rare genetic
diseases. Herpes simplex virus and


adenovirus vectors have also been
evaluated in early-stage human trials
for treating brain tumors.
In recent years, a new gene-
editing method, CRISPR (Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palin-
dromic Repeats), has begun to rewrite
“conventional” gene therapy. The new
technique uses RNA-guided enzymes
to snip out or add DNA segments to
a cell, allowing researchers to make
extremely precise changes in a cell’s
genome. Neuroscientists have already
used CRISPR to repair part of a gene
that produces toxic protein aggregates
in the brains of mouse models of
Huntington’s disease. When scientists
looked at the mouse brains a few weeks
after the procedure, the aggregated
proteins typical of Huntington’s were
almost gone, and the animals’ motor
abilities had amazingly improved.
Of course, the usefulness of



gene-editing technologies goes far
beyond direct therapeutic applications.
With CRISPR, dozens of mouse (and
other animal) models can be made
much more efficiently, facilitating stud-
ies of the brain and mental illness. But
the technology is still relatively new, and
it’s not perfect. The CRISPR system
can make unintended cuts in the DNA
if sequences are similar enough, so that
unintended mutations could arise that
affect the health of the animal being
studied. In addition, this technology is
not yet useful for treating complex con-
ditions like schizophrenia and autism,
which are thought to involve multiple
genes. As with all new technologies,
the ethical issues of using CRISPR as a
gene therapy in humans are being hotly
contested. Only time will tell whether
CRISPR can be added to the expanding
list of technologies that solve problems
of the human brain.



Stem cell and gene therapies hold huge potential for treating brain diseases. Therapeutic
genetic material can be introduced in the brain though engineered viruses, while stem cells
can be used to replace damaged or diseased cells in the brain.


**B**


y this time, you’ve learned a
great deal about your brain
and how complicated it is. The
preceding chapters have mostly looked
at the brain as a part of a thinking,
behaving, and feeling individual.
But you rarely live your life as an
isolated individual. In fact, you prob-
ably interact with a wide variety of
people every day, from bus drivers to
store clerks to your best friend. Those
interactions, along with the interac-
tions of people around you, form the
basis of our society. It makes sense that
what you’ve learned about the brains
of individuals can help you understand
groups of individuals — human societ-
ies — and how they function.
Neuroscientists constantly discover
new things about the forces that drive
the brain. If insights into questions like
“How do I make decisions?” or “What
causes addiction?” can change one per-
son’s life, they can have an even greater
influence on groups of people, some-
times even inspiring them to transform
the societies in which they live.
Many questions require critical
thinking about how the human mind
works: “Who decides what the law
should be?” “What makes laws fair?”
“How can we design the economy, and
what groups of people does it leave
behind?” Answering these questions
requires a thoughtful understand-
ing of the workings of the human
mind. Neuroscience can provide
evidence-based arguments for how to
build a society, rooted in a solid under-
standing of brain science.
It might sound like science fiction,
but the more we discover about the
brain, the greater its potential to trans-
form human society. Scientists need to
grapple with the ethical dimensions of
their work, engaging in conversations
with sociologists, lawyers, politicians,

economists, and philosophers to deter-
mine the best ways to build on their
groundbreaking revelations about the
human brain.

**NEUROLAW**
In earlier chapters, you
learned all about decision-
making, but many decisions have
more drastic consequences than
whether to buy a taco or stir fry for
lunch. Behind every crime that makes
the news is a decision — or a series of
decisions — that may have individu-
als facing the legal consequences of
breaking the law. As with so many
things (including the brain), the more
closely you look at this issue, the
more complicated it gets.
Take addiction, for example. In
the last few decades, the American
prison population has grown by
about 500 percent, largely because
of drug-related arrests. In this book,
you’ve learned how drug use affects the
brain and is associated with signifi-
cant changes to the prefrontal cortex
(PFC), a part of the brain that oversees
impulse control and suppressing crav-
ings. Those changes in the PFC make
resisting drug use much more difficult.
Seen this way, ongoing drug use looks
less like a bad decision and more like a
symptom of a disease: addiction.
Now lawyers, judges, and scientists
have to decide how drug users should
be treated by the criminal justice sys-
tem. Should they continue to be jailed,
as a punishment for their decision to
break the law? Or should they receive
therapy or rehabilitation to treat, and
help them recover from their altered
brain states? Or should they receive
some combination of both? What is
the perfect balance?
Many examples muddy the waters
of decision-making and punishment.


In one famous case, an individual who
had brain surgery to remove a tumor
suddenly developed a compulsion
to view child pornography. During
his trial, the man’s doctor provided
evidence that the surgery had dam-
aged a part of the brain that typically
suppresses such dark urges. Personality
changes after brain surgeries are not
uncommon — was it possible that his
terrible fixation was a side effect of his
life-saving surgery? If so, what should
his punishment be? If the behavior
wasn’t his “fault,” what does a just
society owe his victims?



These are not easy questions to
answer. They require us to temper our
notions of fairness and justice with
new scientific knowledge. The more
neuroscience reveals to us about the
mechanisms underlying memory, per-
sonal responsibility, and behavior, the
more we must accommodate our social
structure to the ramifications of these
new discoveries.
For another example, consider
eyewitness testimony, a common tool
in the courtroom. Studies have found
that the testimony of people who
actually witnessed a crime is very con-
vincing to juries — more convincing



than many types of forensic evidence.
But recent research has shown that
human memory is far from perfect,
especially as time passes after a crime.
As witnesses recall their memories,
they introduce errors, which are then
reconsolidated into new memories.
This is true of even the most memo-
rable events. In a study of New York
City residents one year after the 9/11
terrorist attacks, their memories of
the event differed in 40 percent of
the details. This doesn’t mean that
eyewitness testimony is useless, but
neuroscience has demonstrated that



it is far from infallible. Judges and
lawyers must now come to terms with
this change of perspective.
Nor is this the first time that
neuroscience has helped to change
the way the courts work. Polygraph
tests, once a staple of television crime
dramas, have been rejected in many
courts (including the United States
Supreme Court) as being unreliable.
This decision was based on the work
of many scientists, who showed that
the physiological reactions mea-
sured by polygraph tests (sweating,
increased heart rate, etc.) are not
definitively linked to guilt or lying.


The more neuroscience reveals to us,

the more we must accommodate our

social structure to the ramifications

of these new discoveries.

After all, dragging an innocent person
to the police station to submit to a lie
detector test might produce the same
symptoms. Reliable lie detection tech-
nology might exist one day, but that
day is too far in the future to affect
current court decisions.

**NEUROECONOMICS**
You are constantly
making financial
decisions for yourself. Should you
stock up on all of your favorite snacks
now that you are at the grocery store,
or come back later for the items when
there is a big sale? Are you saving
enough for college? Do you like that
new sports car enough to put up with
its poor gas mileage? In recent years,
economists and neuroscientists have
begun collaborating to investigate the
brain processes behind these decisions.
This field, called “neuroeconomics,”
has the potential to significantly
alter the way people think about
the economy.
A driving force behind modern
capitalism is the belief that individuals
make rational purchasing decisions
— that everyone acting in their own
self-interest creates a system in which
resources will be distributed as fairly
as possible. Yet that theory doesn’t ex-
plain why so many economic decisions
are irrational, or based on gut instinct
and rationalized later. Neuroeconomics
is especially interested in those situa-
tions where choices are less clear-cut
or rational and involve unknown (or
unacknowledged) factors and risk.
To learn more about these deci-
sions, scientists have measured brain
activity as people complete economic
tasks — for example, running brain
scans as people play a simple double-
or-nothing game. When a player de-
cides to risk it all to double winnings,


activity increases in a part of the brain
called the insular cortex. Scientists hy-
pothesize that networks of the insular
cortex interact with other brain areas,
including parts of the limbic system
that function in learning, memory and
emotion, to let the player picture the
negative consequences of taking such
a risk. Suddenly risking a mortgage
payment at the blackjack table might
not look so appealing.
Scientists have also discovered that
our hormones play a role in economic
decisions. In one case, some partic-
ipants in an investment game were



given a dose of oxytocin, a hormone
long associated with social bonding.
Those who received the oxytocin boost
were more trusting with their money
and invested larger amounts with a
broker. However, if they made invest-
ments through a computer program
rather than a person, the oxytocin had
no effect on their investment strat-
egy. These results suggest that social
and neurobiological factors interact
to play a role in such decisions, and
these kinds of effects are at the heart
of many economic decisions. More
research in this area could lead to more
rational investment strategies.



Another study of male stock trad-
ers looked at levels of the hormones
testosterone and cortisol. Researchers
took saliva samples from a small group
of traders every day during a work
week, before and after the bulk of
their work was done. On days when
the traders had higher testosterone
levels than average, they took larger
risks. However, higher-than-average
levels of cortisol (a hormone associated
with stress) correlated with risk-averse
behavior. With millions of dollars on
the line, hormones could be making
the difference between a good day at



the market and a very bad one.
Neuroscience can change our
current thoughts about the economy
in many other ways. Research on
autism spectrum disorders is discov-
ering promising treatments, but also
revealing opportunities for workplaces
to employ the unique abilities of neu-
rodiverse people. Research into reward
pathways and the way your brain
promotes impulsive behavior can help
prevent making purchases and deci-
sions that you would regret. Scientists
are also studying unconscious biases
and discrimination, in an effort to help
eliminate negative prejudices in hiring

and employment. These are only a few
of the practical applications of neu-
roscience, and more are anticipated.
Sometime in the near future, neuro-
science could have all the tools needed
to design a better, and more inclusive,
economic system.

**ETHICS AND THE FUTURE
OF NEUROSCIENCE**
Modern science has
the potential to change
some of the most fundamental beliefs
of our society. Brain science, in particu-
lar, has raised many ethical issues.
Consider the history of brain research,
where early attempts to understand the
brain started or exacerbated practices
such as phrenology, eugenics, forced
sterilization, and unnecessary loboto-
mies. When the ethical frameworks of
science fail, it can incur consequences
that affect not only individuals, but
society as a whole.
In the future, new technologies
that are already on the horizon will
raise serious ethical questions. Genetics
is one area under intense scrutiny. As
you’ve read in this book, you’ve seen
that many brain diseases have their
roots in your genetic code, and scien-
tists are now able to screen for some
of these diseases while children are
in the womb. Emerging technologies
might soon help us identify potential
problems and alter a child’s genes to
prevent it. But is it ethical to alter an
unborn child’s genetics to cure autism?
Other genetic diseases, like Hunting-
ton’s, will only manifest much later in
life. Is it acceptable to “pre-treat” this
disease with genetic alterations? What


about making children smarter or in-
creasing their chance of getting a per-
fect math score on their SATs? Some
people believe that all children have
the right to be genetically enhanced,
while others insist that they retain the
right not to be enhanced.
And who would have access to
these enhancements? Will they only
be available to children of the rich and
powerful, leaving most of us behind?
Similar questions can be asked of other
therapies, like drugs or devices like
transcranial stimulation, which alter
the brain in order to treat it.
In the past, these questions were
often posed by authors of science fic-
tion. But with the startling technolog-
ical advances of recent decades, these
real-world challenges might be closer
than you think. In fact, many scientists
and doctors already deal with serious
ethical quandaries created by neurosci-
ence. For example, scientists can detect
specific biomarkers for disorders such
as depression, psychosis, and certain
types of chronic pain. Are medical
professionals obligated to take steps to
treat a disease or disorder that cur-
rently shows no symptoms and might
never actually materialize? When is the
right time to intervene?
There are even thornier questions
to consider: When getting permission
to treat the brain in some way, the
organ that gives consent is the same as
the organ being treated. How does that
affect the idea of “informed consent”
in cases like Alzheimer’s disease or a
debilitating brain tumor? Should a
doctor proceed with treatment when
the patient (that is, his or her brain)



might not have had the ability to
properly consent?
The questions raised in this chap-
ter have no easy answers. Your respons-
es could depend on your religion, your
socioeconomic class — and, yes, on
the activity of your hormones, your
neurotransmitters, and the progressive
maturation and aging of your nervous
system. The brain is the most compli-
cated structure in the known universe,
and investigating its mysteries seems to
produce as many questions as answers
— and these questions are scientific,
ethical, legal and social. But the prog-
ress of science has always stirred up
“inconvenient” questions about ethical
behavior, social conventions, and the
proper use of our institutions. Asking
those questions early will help re-
searchers and the public work together
to create strong ethical frameworks for
our evolving society.
Science is an ongoing process.
Neuroscience has made many ben-
eficial advances, but facts are also
evolving as discoveries emerge. We are
only on the very cusp of understand-
ing the billions of cells and trillions
of connections that form the human
brain. Stay curious about the neuro-
science you read in the news, keeping
in mind what you have learned in this
book to give you context behind the
headlines. You are part of science, too.
Dialogues between scientists are as
vital as dialogues between neuroscien-
tists and society. Creating a forum for
debate and discussion holds out the
best hope of answering questions in
ways that advance our society now
and in the future.

Acetylcholine A critical neurotransmitter
that controls functions such as memory, atten-
tion, sleep, heart rate, and muscular activity.



Action Potential An electrical charge
that travels along the axon to the neuron’s
terminal, where it triggers the release of a
neurotransmitter. This occurs when a neuron
is activated and temporarily reverses the
electrical state of its interior membrane from
negative to positive.



Addiction Loss of control over drug intake
or compulsive seeking and taking of drugs,
despite adverse consequences.



Adenosine A neurochemical that inhibits
wakefulness, serving the purpose of slowing
down cellular activity and diminishing arous-
al. Adenosine levels decrease during sleep.



Adrenal Gland An endocrine organ that
secretes hormones. The outer layer (adrenal
cortex) secretes the stress hormone cortisol.
The inner portion (adrenal medulla) secretes
epinephrine and norepinephrine in concert
with the activation of the sympathetic nervous
system in the “fight or flight” response.



Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) A major cause
of dementia in the elderly, this neurodegener-
ative disorder is characterized by the death of
neurons in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
and other brain regions. The earliest symp-
toms of the disease include forgetfulness; dis-
orientation as to time or place; and difficulty
with concentration, calculation, language, and
judgment. In the final stages, individuals are
incapable of self-care and may be bedridden.



Amnesia A memory impairment usually
caused by brain damage or disease, or by
drugs such as some anesthetics. People with
amnesia may be unable to recall events from
the past, form new memories, or both.



Amygdala A structure in the forebrain that
is an important component of the limbic
system and plays a central role in emotional
learning, particularly within the context

blood-brain barrier.



Attention A state of arousal in which the
brain’s sensory processing is directed at a
limited number of stimuli. Voluntary (en-
dogenous) attention is a conscious decision
to focus on a particular stimulus. Involuntary
(exogenous) attention is an unplanned focus
on a change in the environment, such as a
loud noise or sudden movement.

peripheral nervous system responsible for
regulating the activity of internal organs.
It includes the sympathetic and parasympa-
thetic nervous systems.



Axon The fiber-like extension of a neuron by
which it sends information to target cells.



Axon Terminal The ends of axons where
neurotransmitters are released to target cells.

mitter) that excites target neurons and
increases the likelihood of their firing an
action potential.

Executive Function Higher-level processing
that takes place in the brain’s prefrontal cortex.
Executive function comprises impulse control,
working memory, and mental flexibility.

Forebrain A region of the developing brain
that goes on to become the cerebral hemi-
spheres and major parts of the limbic system.

establish homeostasis.



Glutamate An amino acid neurotransmit-
ter that acts to excite neurons. Glutamate
stimulates N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)
and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisox-
azole-4-propionic acid (AMPA). AMPA
receptors have been implicated in activities
ranging from learning and memory to devel-
opment and specification of nerve contacts in
developing animals. Stimulation of NMDA
receptors may promote beneficial changes,
whereas overstimulation may be a cause of
nerve cell damage or death in neurological

membrane potential in which the cytoplasm
becomes more negatively charged and there-
fore less likely to fire an action potential.



Hypothalamus A complex brain structure
composed of many nuclei with various func-
tions, including regulating the activities of
internal organs, monitoring information from
the autonomic nervous system, controlling
the pituitary gland, and regulating sleep

the part of the body controlled by those cells
cannot function. A stroke can result in loss of
consciousness and death.



Substantia Nigra A region of the midbrain
involved in movement and reward. Parkinson’s
disease destroys the dopamine-producing
neurons in this region.



Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) A small
group of nerve cells in the hypothalamus that
express clock proteins, which go through a
biochemical cycle of about 24 hours. This
sets the pace for daily cycles of activity, sleep,
hormone release, and other bodily functions.



Sympathetic Branch A branch of the
autonomic nervous system responsible for
mobilizing the body’s energy and resources
during times of stress and arousal.



Synapse A physical gap between two neu-
rons that functions as the site of information
transfer from one neuron to another.



Synaptic Plasticity The ability of synapses
to alter their strength by changing their size,
shape, number of receptors, and amount of
neurotransmitter released.



Synaptic Pruning The elimination of weak
or non-functioning synapses to fine-tune
neural circuitry.



Taste Buds A sensory organ found on
the tongue.



Temporal Lobes One of the four major
subdivisions of each hemisphere of the
cerebral cortex. The temporal lobe functions
in auditory perception, speech, and complex
visual perceptions.



Testosterone A sex hormone produced pri-
marily in the testes but also in lower amounts
in the adrenal cortex and ovaries.



Thalamus A structure consisting of two
egg-shaped masses of nerve tissue, each about
the size of a walnut, deep within the brain.
The key relay station for sensory information
flowing into the brain, the thalamus filters out
information of particular importance from the
mass of signals entering the brain.



Trophic Factors Small proteins in the
nervous system that are necessary for the de-
velopment, function, and survival of specific
groups of neurons.



Vagus Nerve The tenth cranial nerve, it
transmits signals from the brain to the heart,
lungs, and digestive tract.



Voluntary Movement A motor action that is
consciously planned and executed.



Wernicke’s Area A region in the temporal
lobe responsible for comprehension
of language.



White Matter The part of the brain that
contains myelinated nerve fibers. The white
matter gets its color from myelin, the insula-
tion covering nerve fibers.



Working Memory A temporary type of
declarative memory, the ability to keep a
piece of information “in mind.” It is limited
to a small amount of data and, unless trans-
ferred to long-term memory, decays within a
few seconds.

The Kavli Foundation


**FOUNDING PARTNERS**


The Kavli Foundation, established by Fred Kavli, is
dedicated to advancing science for the benefit of humanity,
promoting public understanding of scientific research, and
supporting scientists and their work. The Foundation’s
mission is implemented through an international program
of research institutes in the fields of astrophysics and
theoretical physics, nanoscience, and neuroscience, and



through the support of conferences, symposia, endowed
professorships, journalism workshops, and other activities.
The Foundation is also a founding partner of the Kavli
Prizes, biennial $1 million prizes that recognize scientists for
their seminal advances in three research areas: astrophysics,
nanoscience, and neuroscience.



Gatsby Charitable Foundation



Gatsby is a trust set up by David Sainsbury to
realize his charitable objectives in plant science research,
neuroscience research, science and engineering education,
economic development in Africa, public policy research
and advice, and the arts.
Gatsby aims to be more than a funder, acting as an
enabler for projects, designing, developing, overseeing and,
in some cases, delivering activities. Gatsby takes a long-



term view as they do not think much can be achieved by
short, one-off projects. Gatsby is always looking to increase
the impact of its limited funds, and is therefore eager to
form partnerships with others who share its goals. Gatsby
supports both large- and small-scale work, employing
different methods and models depending on the different
challenges, but is always ultimately looking to deliver
long-term, sustainable change.


### 136 Brain Facts |society for neuroscience


SfN’s mission is to:
■ Advance the understanding of the brain and
the nervous system by bringing together
scientists of diverse backgrounds, by facilitating
the integration of research directed at all levels
of biological organization, and by encouraging
translational research and the application of
new scientific knowledge to develop improved
disease treatments and cures.



■ Provide professional development activities,
information, and educational resources for
neuroscientists at all stages of their careers,
including undergraduates, graduates, and
postdoctoral fellows, and increase participation
of scientists from a diversity of cultural and
ethnic backgrounds.



The Society for Neuroscience (SfN) is the world’s largest organization of scientists and physicians
devoted to understanding the brain and nervous system. The nonprofit organization, founded in
1969, now has nearly 37,000 members in more than 90 countries and over 130 chapters worldwide.



SfN’s mission emphasizes the importance of engaging and inspiring the public about the
progress and promise of brain research. BrainFacts.org, a public information initiative of The
Kavli Foundation, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, and SfN, provides trusted, authoritative
information to the public about the brain and nervous system.



■ Promote public information and general
education about the nature of scientific
discovery and the results and implications of
the latest neuroscience research. Support active
and continuing discussions on ethical issues
relating to the conduct and outcomes
of neuroscience research.



■ Inform legislators and other policymakers
about new scientific knowledge and recent
developments in neuroscience research and
their implications for public policy, societal
benefit, and continued scientific progress.
