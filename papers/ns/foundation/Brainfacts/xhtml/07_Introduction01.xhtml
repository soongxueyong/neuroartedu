<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>euroscience is rapidly advancing what we know about the brain, the nervous system, and ourselves. It&#x2019;s often difficult to keep up with every discovery. Just as we were producing this book, The Brain Prize for 2017 was awarded to neuroscientists whose research explains the brain&#x2019;s learning and reward system. That discovery helps us to understand the behaviors that trigger compulsive gambling and drug and alcohol addiction. Then, the 2017 Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology honored researchers who revealed the inner workings of circadian rhythms, our body&#x2019;s internal clock, and The Brain Prize for 2018 recognized discoveries about the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s and Parkinson&#x2019;s disease.</p>
<p class="indentt">Discovery doesn&#x2019;t happen overnight, but the field has generated significant eureka moments since our last edition. Here we can take a moment to slow down and explore the fundamentals behind the research and discoveries that have built neuroscience. This eighth edition of <i>Brain Facts</i> contains our most current understanding of what we know <i>today</i> about the brain while addressing emerging topics in the field.</p>
<p class="indentt">Underpinning every new discovery are the concepts and principles that neuroscientists have established in more than a century of studying the brain. Members of the Society for Neuroscience articulated those concepts more than a decade ago as Core Concepts &#x2014; the eight ideas that people need to know about their brain and nervous system. Here, Core Concepts provide touchstones for deepening your understanding of the material presented. For example, information about circadian rhythms fits into the context of the concept that the brain uses specific circuits to process information. The role of the learning and reward systems in behaviors such as compulsive gambling and addiction illustrates the concept that the brain uses inference, emotion, memory, and imagination to make predictions.</p>
<p class="indentt">Core Concepts icons throughout the text offer you the opportunity to place information in the book into the wider context of neuroscience as a whole. They serve as a foundation upon which you can build more detailed knowledge. If you need a reference point, don&#x2019;t forget to use the extended cover flap to remind you of the Core Concepts along the way, or as a bookmark during your reading.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="5" id="page_5"/>A human brain contains roughly 86 billion nerve cells, or neurons. Contrary to popular misconception, we use all of the neurons in our brains, not just some small fraction of them.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of those neurons exchanges electrical signals with thousands of other neurons to create the countless circuits that, along with the nerves throughout our bodies, form our nervous system. In the course of millions of years, our nervous systems have evolved from much simpler beginnings. Roundworms, fruit flies, zebrafish, salamanders, mice, and monkeys all possess nervous systems that share fundamental similarities with the human nervous system. The nervous system keeps our bodies in sync by communicating with all other parts of our bodies, like the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, the immune system, etc. With so many interconnected parts, however, there are endless ways for things to go wrong. From Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease to depression, an estimated one in four people worldwide will face a neurological or psychiatric condition, causing enormous financial and social burdens. The promise of solving these problems lies in unraveling the mysteries of the brain and nervous system.</p>

<p class="indent1">Your brain can serve as your body&#x2019;s command center because neurons communicate with each other. They relay messages throughout your body and power all of your thoughts and actions. Neurons talk to each other using both electrical and chemical signals.</p>
<p class="indent">When you stub your toe, sensory neurons create electrical signals, called action potentials, which travel rapidly down a neuron. Those electrical signals, however, cannot cross the gap between two neurons.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to communicate, the action potential is transformed into a chemical message, which crosses the gap, called a synapse. The release of chemical messengers can trigger a second action potential in the neuron on the other side of the synapse, conveying the message onward or, when the action potential triggers the release of a chemical messenger that blunts the transmission of a signal, quelling the message.</p>
<p class="indent">This happens over and over, and with repeated activity, the synapse grows stronger, so the next message is more likely to get through. That way, neurons learn to pass on important messages and ignore the rest. This is how our brains learn and adapt to an ever-changing world.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="6" id="page_6"/>Your nervous system is filled with circuits made up of neurons that relay messages around your brain and body. They&#x2019;re responsible for everything you think, do, say, and feel. Sensory circuits carry signals from sense receptors to your brain. Motor circuits send commands to your muscles. Simple circuits carry out your automatic reflexes.</p>
<p class="indent">Higher-level activities like memory, decision-making, and perceiving the world around you require complex circuits.</p>
<p class="indent">All of these circuits arise before you&#x2019;re born, when genes direct neurons to assemble simple circuits in your developing brain. As your neurons and their connections change from new experiences and environments, those simple circuits become much more complex. These changes happen mostly in childhood but continue over your whole life &#x2014; all a part of building a better brain.</p>

<p class="indent1">You&#x2019;ve had most of the neurons in your brain since birth. Most of those will stick around for the rest of your life, yet your brain is constantly changing &#x2014; neuroscientists call this plasticity. Learn a new skill or language and your brain reacts by strengthening or weakening the connections between neurons &#x2014; even creating new ones. Each new experience shapes your brain to become uniquely yours.</p>
<p class="indent">That capacity to change is vital. A brain damaged by injury or disease may eventually regain lost abilities &#x2014; rerouting connections and sometimes even growing new neurons, but only quite slowly if at all. At the same time, in a healthy brain neurons die off, too. During development, the human brain grows an excess of neurons. Early in life, the brain eliminates those extra cells, keeping only those connections you need in a process called synaptic pruning. Later on, unused neurons can wither away. Physical and mental exercise preserves them, keeping your brain healthy.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="7" id="page_7"/>Your brain&#x2019;s roughly 86 billion interconnected neurons endow it with the ability to understand the world, plan actions, and solve problems. Doing so requires the brain to incorporate all available information. By combining information from all of your body&#x2019;s senses, the brain paints a picture of the world around you. Then, using inference and instinct, the brain makes sense of the picture it assembles.</p>
<p class="indent">The brain both makes and uses emotions, which are value judgments that help the brain respond effectively to events. It associates the pictures it assembles with feelings to form memories. Our brains store those memories, learn from them, and use that knowledge in the future. By combining all of these tools with imagination, your brain can predict future events, calculate your next move, and devise plans for future opportunities. Consciousness requires that all of these activities function normally. In other words, your brain&#x2019;s trillions of connections work together to understand the world, to think about the future, and to create &#x2026; you.</p>

<p class="indent1">One thing that makes humans special is our talent for talking. Whether it&#x2019;s a professor&#x2019;s technical discourse or a late night comic&#x2019;s zingy one-liner, humans communicate in ways that are far more complex than those of other animals because our brains are amply wired for it.</p>
<p class="indent">Compared with other animals, the human brain possesses an enormous cerebral cortex that is brimming with neural circuits dedicated to language. Neurons in the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes of the cortex form circuits that interpret the sounds and symbols of language.</p>
<p class="indent">We use those circuits to generate words, turn them into sounds, and understand the sounds we hear back. From birth, our brains are primed to learn language. Language endows us with thoughts and creativity. With it, we can trade ideas and information, share our observations, and let others build on our discoveries. Over time, that has led to human culture and all of the inventions of modern society.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="8" id="page_8"/>Did you know that your brain runs on only 25 watts of electricity &#x2014; enough to power an LED light bulb? Or that there are nearly 10,000 different types of neurons in your brain? The fact that we know these things &#x2014; or even care &#x2014; is due to a special ability that arises in our complex brains: curiosity.</p>
<p class="indent">From a very early age, curiosity drives us to understand our world, our communities, our bodies, and even our own brains. For the last two hundred years, the study of neuroscience has allowed us to do just that. We&#x2019;ve learned how individual neurons work at a molecular level, and how billions of them work together to let you talk, learn, and imagine. We are learning why sugar is so hard to avoid, how exercise helps the brain, and why the urge to scratch when we have an itch is so irresistible.</p>
<p class="indent">Along the way, this exploration has led to innumerable insights that have helped us to solve human problems. We have treatments for pain and Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, and more are on their way. Depression and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease are divulging their secrets. Still, much remains to be learned about the brain, and there are many more discoveries to be made.</p>

<p class="indent1">The United Nations estimates that neurological and psychiatric conditions like Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, and depression afflict one in four people worldwide. They cause more total disability than do heart attacks, cancers, or HIV/AIDS each year, inflicting profound suffering and robbing patients of health and independence. In doing so, they also leach an estimated $1.5 trillion from the U.S. economy alone. Those numbers, and the human stories behind them, are among the driving forces behind neuroscience.</p>
<p class="indent">Neuroscientists study the biology of nerves and the brain, in both animals and humans, in order to understand these destructive conditions &#x2014; and ultimately find a treatment or cure. When a promising treatment emerges, neuroscientists work with other medical professionals to carefully test the remedy in animals and, eventually, in humans. If it proves safe and effective in those tests, the medicine is approved for patients nationwide. Researchers have been using that process to fight the devastation of neurological disorders and mental illness for decades.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, it led to the medication L-dopa, which has helped millions of patients to beat back symptoms of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. In the 1990s, it yielded a class of drugs called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, like Prozac, to treat depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, neuroscience research is leading to promising advances for a host of conditions, from Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease to epilepsy to schizophrenia. In a field in which every advance has the chance to help ease suffering, research is more than a job: It&#x2019;s a human imperative.</p>

<p class="figcaption">In the center of the rosette are precursor cells, specialized cells that create new neurons and glia by dividing themselves. The red ring is a visualization of the connections between these precursor cells. As they generate new neurons and glia, the newborn cells radiate out from the center of the rosette to the outer edge of the brain using the precursor cells as a scaffolding, marked in green. With this model, scientists can directly observe the processes behind the developing human brain from the earliest stages.</p>
