<p class="image1"><img src="../images/bm1_1.jpg" alt="Image"/></p>
<p class="h1u">The Kavli Foundation</p>
<p class="indent">The Kavli Foundation, established by Fred Kavli, is dedicated to advancing science for the benefit of humanity, promoting public understanding of scientific research, and supporting scientists and their work. The Foundation&#x2019;s mission is implemented through an international program of research institutes in the fields of astrophysics and theoretical physics, nanoscience, and neuroscience, and through the support of conferences, symposia, endowed professorships, journalism workshops, and other activities. The Foundation is also a founding partner of the Kavli Prizes, biennial $1 million prizes that recognize scientists for their seminal advances in three research areas: astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience.</p>

<p class="h1u">Gatsby Charitable Foundation</p>
<p class="indent">Gatsby is a trust set up by David Sainsbury to realize his charitable objectives in plant science research, neuroscience research, science and engineering education, economic development in Africa, public policy research and advice, and the arts.</p>
<p class="indent">Gatsby aims to be more than a funder, acting as an enabler for projects, designing, developing, overseeing and, in some cases, delivering activities. Gatsby takes a longterm view as they do not think much can be achieved by short, one-off projects. Gatsby is always looking to increase the impact of its limited funds, and is therefore eager to form partnerships with others who share its goals. Gatsby supports both large- and small-scale work, employing different methods and models depending on the different challenges, but is always ultimately looking to deliver long-term, sustainable change.</p>
<p class="image1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="136" id="page_136"/><img src="../images/bm1_3.jpg" alt="Image"/></p>
<p class="indentu">The Society for Neuroscience (SfN) is the world&#x2019;s largest organization of scientists and physicians devoted to understanding the brain and nervous system. The nonprofit organization, founded in 1969, now has nearly 37,000 members in more than 90 countries and over 130 chapters worldwide.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="blue">SfN&#x2019;s mission is to:</span></p>
<p class="bbull"><span class="blue">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Advance the understanding of the brain and the nervous system by bringing together scientists of diverse backgrounds, by facilitating the integration of research directed at all levels of biological organization, and by encouraging translational research and the application of new scientific knowledge to develop improved disease treatments and cures.</p>
<p class="bbullt"><span class="blue">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Provide professional development activities, information, and educational resources for neuroscientists at all stages of their careers, including undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral fellows, and increase participation of scientists from a diversity of cultural and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p class="bbullt"><span class="blue">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Promote public information and general education about the nature of scientific discovery and the results and implications of the latest neuroscience research. Support active and continuing discussions on ethical issues relating to the conduct and outcomes of neuroscience research.</p>
<p class="bbullt"><span class="blue">&#x25A0;</span>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Inform legislators and other policymakers about new scientific knowledge and recent developments in neuroscience research and their implications for public policy, societal benefit, and continued scientific progress.</p>
<p class="indentt">SfN&#x2019;s mission emphasizes the importance of engaging and inspiring the public about the progress and promise of brain research. <a href="http://BrainFacts.org">BrainFacts.org</a>, a public information initiative of The Kavli Foundation, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, and SfN, provides trusted, authoritative information to the public about the brain and nervous system.</p>
